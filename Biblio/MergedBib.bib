@article{amarasekare2002a,
	Abstract = {Interference competition is ubiquitous in nature. Yet its effects on resource exploitation remain largely unexplored for species that compete for dynamic resources. Here, I present a model of exploitative and interference competition with explicit resource dynamics. The model incorporates both biotic and abiotic resources. It considers interference competition both in the classical sense (i.e. each species suffers a net reduction in per capita growth rate via interference from, and interference on, the other species) and in the broad sense (i.e. each species suffers a net reduction in per capita growth rate via interference from, but can experience an increase in growth rate via interference on, the other species). Coexistence cannot occur under classical interference competition even when the species inferior at resource exploitation is superior at interference. Such a trade-off can, however, change the mechanism of competitive exclusion from dominance by the superior resource exploiter to a priority effect. Now the inferior resource exploiter can exclude the superior resource exploiter provided it has a higher initial abundance. By contrast, when interference is beneficial to the interacting species, coexistence is possible via a trade-off between exploitation and interference. These results hold regardless of whether the resource is biotic or abiotic, indicating that the outcome of exploitative and interference competition does not depend on the exact nature of resource dynamics. The model makes two key predictions. First, species that engage in costly interference mechanisms (e.g. territoriality, overgrowth or undercutting, allelopathy and other forms of chemical competition) should not be able to coexist unless they also engage in beneficial interference mechanisms (e.g. predation or parasitism). Second, exotic invasive species that displace native biota should be superior resource exploiters that have strong interference effects on native species with little or negative cost. The first prediction provides a potential explanation for patterns observed in several natural systems, including plants, aquatic invertebrates and insects. The second prediction is supported by data on invasive plants and vertebrates},

@article{arditi1989a,
	Abstract = {In continuous-time predator-prey models, the per capita rate of consumption (the functional response or trophic function) is usually interpreted as a behavioral phenomenon. The classical assumptions are that predators encounter prey at random and that the trophic function depends on prey abundance only. We argue that this approach is not always appropriate. The trophic function must be considered on the slow time scale of population dynamics at which the models operatenot on the fast behavioral time scale. We propose that, in cases where these two time scales differ, it is reasonable to assume that the trophic function depends on the ratio of prey to predator abundances. Several field and laboratory observations support this hypothesis. We compare the consequences of the two types of dependence with respect to the dynamical properties of the models and the responses of population equilibria to variations in primary production. In traditional prey-dependent models, only the predator population responds to primary production, while both levels respond in ratio-dependent models. This result is generalized to food chains. We suggest that the ratio-dependent form of the trophic function is a simple way of accounting for many types of heterogeneity that occur in large scale natural systems, while the prey-dependent form may be more appropriate for homogeneous systems like chemostats.},

@article{claessen2004a,
	Abstract = {Cannibalism is characterized by four aspects: killing victims, gaining energy from victims, size-dependent interactions and intraspecific competition. In this review of mathematical models of cannibalistic populations, we relate the predicted population dynamic consequences of cannibalism to its four defining aspects. We distinguish five classes of effects of cannibalism: (i) regulation of population size; (ii) destabilization resulting in population cycles or chaos; (iii) stabilization by damping population cycles caused by other interactions; (iv) bistability such that, depending on the initial conditions, the population converges to one of two possible stable states; and (v) modification of the population size structure. The same effects of cannibalism may be caused by different combinations of aspects of cannibalism. By contrast, the same combination of aspects may lead to different effects. For particular cannibalistic species, the consequences of cannibalism will depend on the presence and details of the four defining aspects. Empirical evidence for the emerged theory of cannibalism is discussed briefly. The implications of the described dynamic effects of cannibalism are discussed in the context of community structure, making a comparison with the community effects of intraguild predation},

	Abstract = {This chapter is intended as a gentle introduction to models of physiologically structured populations, as developed by Metz and Diekmann (1986) (hereafter, PSP models; the origin of the adjective physiologically structured is described in Section 2 after some necessary definitions). You will need a basic knowledge of mathematical modeling but no familiarity with PSP models or the ensuing partial differential equations. My aim is to equip you with enough skills to be able to use moderately complex PSP models for specific biological applications. Hence, I emphasize the formulation of the models, the biological interpretation of the equations, and the tools for studying the models. The mathematical background of the modeling framework and the justification of the equations are discussed only when necessary for a better understanding of the biological aspects of the models.},

@article{de-roos2013a,
	Abstract = {Body size ( biomass) is the dominant determinant of population dynamical processes such as giving birth or dying in almost all species, with often drastically different behaviour occurring in different parts of the growth trajectory, while the latter is largely determined by food availability at the different life stages. This leads to the question under what conditions unstructured population models, formulated in terms of total population biomass, still do a fair job. To contribute to answering this question we first analyze the conditions under which a size-structured model collapses to a dynamically equivalent unstructured one in terms of total biomass. The only biologically meaningful case where this occurs is when body size does not affect any of the population dynamic processes, this is the case if and only if the mass-specific ingestion rate, the mass-specific biomass production and the mortality rate of the individuals are independent of size, a condition to which we refer as "ontogenetic symmetry". Intriguingly, under ontogenetic symmetry the equilibrium biomass-body size spectrum is proportional to 1/size, a form that has been conjectured for marine size spectra and subsequently has been used as prior assumption in theoretical papers dealing with the latter. As a next step we consider an archetypical class of models in which reproduction takes over from growth upon reaching an adult body size, in order to determine how quickly discrepancies from ontogenetic symmetry lead to relevant novel population dynamical phenomena. The phenomena considered are biomass overcompensation, when additional imposed mortality leads, rather unexpectedly, to an increase in the equilibrium biomass of either the juveniles or the adults (a phenomenon with potentially big consequences for predators of the species), and the occurrence of two types of size-structure driven oscillations, juvenile-driven cycles with separated extended cohorts, and adult-driven cycles in which periodically a front of relatively steeply decreasing frequencies moves up the size distribution. A small discrepancy from symmetry can already lead to biomass overcompensation; size-structure driven cycles only occur for somewhat larger discrepancies},

	Abstract = {Folsomia candida Willem 1902, a member of the order Collembola (colloquially called springtails), is a common and widespread arthropod that occurs in soils throughout the world. The species is parthenogenetic and is easy to maintain in the laboratory on a diet of granulated dry yeast. F. candida has been used as a "standard" test organism for more than 40 years for estimating the effects of pesticides and environmental pollutants on nontarget soil arthropods. However, it has also been employed as a model for the investigation of numerous other phenomena such as cold tolerance, quality as a prey item, and effects of microarthropod grazing on pathogenic fungi and mycorrhizae of plant roots. In this comprehensive review, aspects of the life history, ecology, and ecotoxicology of F. candida are covered. We focus on the recent literature, especially studies that have examined the effects of soil pollutants on reproduction in F. candida using the protocol published by the International Standards Organization in 1999},

@article{mallard2013a,
	Abstract = {1. Because of recent technological improvements in the way computer and digital camera perform, the potential use of imaging for contributing to the study of communities, populations or individuals in laboratory microcosms has risen enormously. However its limited use is due to difficulties in the automation of image analysis. 2. We present an accurate and flexible method of image analysis for detecting, counting and measuring moving particles on a fixed but heterogeneous substrate. This method has been specifically designed to follow individuals, or entire populations, in experimental laboratory microcosms. It can be used in other applications. 3. The method consists in comparing multiple pictures of the same experimental microcosm in order to generate an image of the fixed background. This background is then used to extract, measure and count the moving organisms, leaving out the fixed background and the motionless or dead individuals. 4. We provide different examples (springtails, ants, nematodes, daphnia) to show that this non intrusive method is efficient at detecting organisms under a wide variety of conditions even on faintly contrasted and heterogeneous substrates. 5. The repeatability and reliability of this method has been assessed using experimental populations of the Collembola Folsomia candida. 6. We present an ImageJ plugin to automate the analysis of digital pictures of laboratory microcosms. The plugin automates the successive steps of the analysis and recursively analyses multiple sets of images, rapidly producing measurements from a large number of replicated microcosms},

@article{mccormick2012a,
	Abstract = {Competition is often most intense between similar sized organisms that have similar ecological requirements. Many coral reef fish species settle preferentially to live coral at the end of their larval phase where they interact with other species that recruited to the same habitat patch at a similar time. Mortality is high and usually selective and individuals must compete for low risk space. This study examined the competitive interactions between two species of juvenile damselfish and the extent to which interactions that occurred within a recruitment cohort established the disjunct distribution patterns that were displayed in later life stages. Censuses and field experiments with juveniles found that one species, the ambon damsel, was dominant immediately after settlement and pushed the subordinate species higher up the reef and further from shelter. Presence of a competitor resulted in reduced growth for both species. Juvenile size was the best predictor of competitive success and outweighed the effects of short term prior residency. Size at settlement also dramatically influenced survival, with slightly larger individuals displaying higher aggression, pushing the subordinate species into higher risk habitats. While subordinates had higher feeding rates, they also sustained higher mortality. The study highlights the importance of interaction dynamics between species within a recruitment cohort to patterns of growth and distribution of species within communities},

@article{tully2008a,
	Abstract = {In a variable yet predictable world, organisms may use environmental cues to make adaptive adjustments to their phenotype. Such phenotypic flexibility is expected commonly to evolve in life history traits, which are closely tied to Darwinian fitness. Yet adaptive life history flexibility remains poorly documented. Here we introduce the collembolan Folsomia candida, a soil-dweller, parthenogenetic (all-female) microarthropod, as a model organism to study the phenotypic expression, genetic variation, fitness consequences and long-term evolution of life history flexibility. We demonstrate that collembola have a remarkable adaptive ability for adjusting their reproductive phenotype: when transferred from harsh to good conditions (in terms of food ration and crowding), a mother can fine-tune the number and the size of her eggs from one clutch to the next. The comparative analysis of eleven clonal populations of worldwide origins reveals (i) genetic variation in mean egg size under both good and bad conditions; (ii) no genetic variation in egg size flexibility, consistent with convergent evolution to a common physiological limit; (iii) genetic variation of both mean reproductive investment and reproductive investment flexibility, associated with a reversal of the genetic correlation between egg size and clutch size between environmental conditions ; (iv) a negative genetic correlation between reproductive investment flexibility and adult lifespan. Phylogenetic reconstruction shows that two life history strategies, called HIFLEX and LOFLEX, evolved early in evolutionary history. HIFLEX includes six of our 11 clones, and is characterized by large mean egg size and reproductive investment, high reproductive investment flexibility, and low adult survival. LOFLEX (the other five clones) has small mean egg size and low reproductive investment, low reproductive investment flexibility, and high adult survival. The divergence of HIFLEX and LOFLEX could represent different adaptations to environments differing in mean quality and variability, or indicate that a genetic polymorphism of reproductive investment reaction norms has evolved under a physiological tradeoff between reproductive investment flexibility and adult lifespan},

	Abstract = {1. Hermaphroditic and gonochoric reproduction are essentially different
	reproductive strategies that may lead to diverging population responses
	to adverse environmental conditions. Each strategy implies different
	physiological mechanisms, which affect life-history traits and represent
	different ways of dealing with stress.
	
	2. We studied the performance of hermaphroditic vs gonochoric strains
	in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans exposed to cadmium stress
	at the individual and population level.
	
	3. Under control conditions, the gonochoric strain started reproduction
	earlier than the hermaphroditic strain at a smaller size. This was
	due to an earlier switch from sperm to oocyte production triggered
	by male sperm availability. Under cadmium stress hermaphrodites showed
	a decrease in the size at onset of reproduction, presumably as a
	strategy to maintain a high population growth rate. In contrast the
	body size of gonochoric nematodes was not affected.
	
	4. A process-based model (DEBtox) was used as a tool for analysing
	life-history data and calculating population growth rates. The model
	fitted the data well using physiologically relevant parameters such
	as ageing, survival or reproduction related parameters. The simultaneous
	fit of all life-history traits was used to obtain populations growth
	rate estimates.
	
	5. The differences between the two C. elegans strains were reflected
	at the population level. Lower population growth rates, as calculated
	by DEBtox, were found in the gonochoric strain, largely determined
	by the proportion of males in the offspring.
	
	6. From the overall results we suggest that the differences found
	between both populations are due to the reproductive strategy. Under
	control conditions, CB strain (with gonochoric reproduction) does
	not favour population growth rates in the short term due to faster
	ageing and copulation costs on survival. Furthermore, in response
	to stress this strain also showed lower performance than the N2 hermaphroditic
	strain, mainly due to a higher sensitivity of survival to the stressor.},

	Abstract = {In many organisms, individuals in colder environments grow more slowly
	but are larger as adults. This widespread pattern is embodied by
	two well-established rules: Bergmann's rule, which describes the
	association between temperature and body size in natural environments,
	and the temperature-size rule, which describes reaction norms relating
	temperature to body size in laboratory experiments. Theory predicts
	that organisms should grow to be larger in colder environments when
	growth efficiency decreases with increasing environmental temperature.
	Using data from 97 laboratory experiments, including 58 species of
	ectotherms, we found little evidence that growth efficiency is negatively
	related to environmental temperature within the thermal range that
	is relevant to the temperature-size rule. Instead, growth efficiency
	was either positively related or insensitive to environmental temperature
	in the majority of cases (73 of 89 cases for gross growth efficiency
	and 18 of 24 cases for net growth efficiency). Two possibilities
	merit consideration. First, high temperatures may impose constraints
	on growth that only arise late during ontogeny; this simple and potentially
	general explanation is supported by the fact that thermal optima
	for growth efficiency and growth rate decrease as individuals grow.
	Alternatively, the general explanation for relationships between
	temperature and body size may not be simple. If the latter view is
	correct, the best approach might be to generate and test theories
	that are tailored specifically to organisms with similar behavior
	and physiology.},

	Abstract = {Although it is widely known that dietary restriction (DR) not only
	extends the longevity of a wide range of species but also reduces
	their reproductive output, the interrelationship of DR, longevity
	extension and reproduction is not well understood in any organism.
	Here we address the question: 'Under what nutritional conditions
	do the longevity-enhancing effects resulting from food restriction
	either counteract, complement or reinforce the mortality costs of
	reproduction? To answer this question we designed a fine-grained
	DR study involving 4800 individuals of the tephritid fruit fly, Anastrepha
	ludens, in which we measured sex-specific survival and daily reproduction
	in females in each of 20 different treatments (sugar : yeast ratios)
	plus 4 starvation controls. The database generated from this 3-year
	study consisted of approximately 100 000 life-days for each sex and
	750 000 eggs distributed over the reproductive lives of 2400 females.
	The fertility and longevity-extending responses were used to create
	contour maps (X-Y grid) that show the demographic responses (Z-axis)
	across dietary gradients that range from complete starvation to both
	ad libitum sugar-only and ad libitum standard diet (3 : 1 sugar :
	yeast). The topographic perspectives reveal demographic equivalencies
	along nutritional gradients, differences in the graded responses
	of males and females, egg production costs that are sensitive to
	the interaction of food amounts and constituents, and orthogonal
	contours (equivalencies in longevity or reproduction) representing
	demographic thresholds related to both caloric content and sugar
	: yeast ratios. In general, the finding that lifespan and reproductive
	maxima occur at much different nutritional coordinates poses a major
	challenge for the use of food restriction (or a mimetic) in humans
	to improve health and extend longevity in humans.},

	Abstract = {1. A graphic technique is presented in which data on age-specific
	reproduction of individuals are portrayed using: (i) a horizontal
	life line, the length of which is propor- tional to individual longevity;
	(ii) colour-coded segments depicting the level of repro- duction
	at each age; and (iii) a cohort survival schedule created by rank-ordering
	individual life lines from shortest- to longest-lived. 2. The resulting
	graphic, referred to as an event history diagram, portrays data at
	the individual level and thus allows visual comparisons of detailed
	life-history patterns such as age of first reproduction, longevity,
	ages of high, medium, low and zero repro- duction, and post-reproductive
	period. 3. Example graphs are shown for reproductive and longevity
	data gathered on 1000 medfly females. The average female lived 35·6
	days and laid 759·3 eggs and therefore the graphs display information
	for 35 600 fly days and the age-distribution of laying for 759 300
	eggs. 4. Because the graphics provide a means for visualizing large
	amounts of data precisely and efficiently, they reveal details and
	nuances in the data that are not apparent from conventional graphic
	methods. 5. The advantages of longitudinal data gathered on individuals
	and reasons why visualizing individual-level data is important are
	discussed.},

	Abstract = {Demographic characteristics of the bacterial-feeding nematode Caenorhabditis
	elegans were determined in two long-lived mutant strains, TJ1052
	(age-1), CB4876 (clk-1), and a wild-type strain, N2. Within each
	strain, there was little correlation between longevity and reproduction
	for individuals that lived longer than 10 days. Long-lived mutant
	strains produced fewer eggs than the wild type. Mean total life spans
	were 13.2 days for the wild type, 21.9 days for age-1, and 15.8 days
	for clk-1; maximum life spans were 24 days for the wild type, 47
	days for age-1, and 32 days for clk-1. Differences in total life
	span resulted primarily from longer post-reproductive survival. The
	mean post-reproductive life spans were longer than the wild type
	by 183\% in age-1 and 60\% in clk-1. We conclude that (i) post-reproductive
	survival is not correlated with egg production within isogenic populations
	of C. elegans, and (ii) the relationship between reproduction and

	Abstract = {Although the causes of population extinction are well understood,
	the speed at which populations decline to extinction is not. A testable,
	counter-intuitive prediction of stochastic population theory is that,
	on average, for any interior interval of the domain of biologically
	attainable population sizes, the expected duration of increase equals
	the expected duration of decline. Here we report the first empirical
	tests of this hypothesis. Using data from two experiments in which
	replicate populations of Daphnia magna were observed to go extinct
	under different experimental conditions, we failed to reject the
	null hypothesis of no difference between the growth and decline phases
	in populations under constant conditions and conditions with modest
	environmental variability, but find strong evidence to reject equal
	first passage time in highly variable environments. These results
	confirm the prediction of equal passage times entailed by diffusion
	models of population dynamics, supporting continued application in
	both population theory and conservation decision making under the
	restricted conditions where the approximation can be expected to
	hold.},

	Abstract = {Although nearly all organisms are subject to fluctuating temperature
	regimes in their natural habitat, little is known about the genetics
	underlying the response to thermal conditions, and even less about
	the genetic differences that cause individual variation in thermal
	response. Here, we aim to elucidate possible pathways involved in
	temperature-induced phenotypic plasticity of growth rate. Our model
	organism is the collembolan Orchesella cincta that occurs in a wide
	variety of habitats and is known to be adapted to local thermal conditions.
	Because sequence information is lacking in O. cincta, we constructed
	cDNA libraries enriched for temperature-responsive genes using suppression
	subtractive hybridization. We compared gene expression of O. cincta
	with steep thermal reaction norms (high plasticity) to those with
	flat thermal reaction norms (low plasticity) for juvenile growth
	after exposure to a temperature switch composed of a cooling or a
	warming treatment. Using suppression subtractive hybridization, we
	found differential expression of ten nuclear genes, including several
	genes involved in energy metabolism, such as pantothenate kinase
	and carbonic anhydrase. In addition, seven mitochondrial genes were
	found in the cloned subtracted library, but further analysis showed
	this was caused by allelic variation in mitochondrial genes in our
	founder population, and that a specific haplotype was associated
	with high thermal responsiveness. Future work will focus on candidate
	genes from pathways such as the oxidative phosphorylation and biosynthesis
	of coenzyme A which are possibly involved in thermal responsiveness
	of juvenile growth rate.},

@article{ellers2011a,
	__Markedentry = {[lebourlot:]},
	Abstract = {Increases in biodiversity can result from an increase in species richness,
	as well as from a higher genetic diversity within species. Intraspecific
	genetic diversity, measured as the number of genotypes, can enhance
	plant primary productivity and have cascading effects at higher trophic
	levels, such as an increase in herbivore and predator richness. The
	positive effects of genotypic mixtures are not only determined by
	additive effects, but also by interactions among genotypes, such
	as facilitation or inhibition. However, so far there has been no
	effort to predict the extent of such effects. In this study, we address
	the question of whether the magnitude of the effect of genotype number
	on population performance can be explained by the extent of dissimilarity
	in key traits among genotypes in a mixture. We examine the relative
	contribution of genotype number and phenotypic dissimilarity among
	genotypes to population performance of the soil arthropod, Orchesella
	cincta. Nearly homogeneous genotypes were created from inbred isofemale
	lines. Phenotypic dissimilarity among genotypes was assessed in terms
	of three life-history traits that are associated with population
	growth rate, i.e., egg size, egg development time, and juvenile growth
	rate. A microcosm experiment with genotype mixtures consisting of
	one, two, four, and eight genotypes, showed that genotypic richness
	strongly increased population size and biomass production and was
	associated with greater net diversity effects. Most importantly,
	there was a positive log-linear relationship between phenotypic dissimilarity
	in a mixture and the net diversity effects for juvenile population
	size and total biomass. In other words, the degree of phenotypic
	dissimilarity among genotypes determined the magnitude of the genotypic
	richness effect, although this relationship leveled off at higher
	values of phenotypic dissimilarity. Although the exact mechanisms
	responsible for these effects are currently unknown, similar advantages
	of trait dissimilarity have been found among species. Hence, to better
	understand population performance, genotype number and phenotypic
	dissimilarity should be considered collectively},

	Abstract = {A recently documented correlate of anthropogenic climate change involves
	reductions in body size, the nature and scale of the pattern leading
	to suggestions of a third universal response to climate warming.
	Because body size affects thermoregulation and energetics, changing
	body size has implications for resilience in the face of climate
	change. A review of recent studies shows heterogeneity in the magnitude
	and direction of size responses, exposing a need for large-scale
	phylogenetically controlled comparative analyses of temporal size
	change. Integrative analyses of museum data combined with new theoretical
	models of size-dependent thermoregulatory and metabolic responses
	will increase both understanding of the underlying mechanisms and
	physiological consequences of size shifts and, therefore, the ability
	to predict the sensitivities of species to climate change.},

	can be modified by such dynamical properties of the population as
	density and stability. It follows that generating predictions and
	testing them correctly requires considering this ecogenetic feedback
	loop whenever traits have demographic consequences, mediated via
	density dependence (or frequency dependence). This is not an easy
	challenge, and arguably theory has advanced at a greater pace than
	empirical research. However, theory would benefit from more interaction
	between related fields, as is evident in the many near-synonymous
	names that the ecogenetic loop has attracted. We also list encouraging
	examples where empiricists have shown feasible ways of addressing
	the question, ranging from advanced data analysis to experiments

	Abstract = {P>1. Demographic theory and empirical studies indicate that cohort
	variation in demographic traits has substantial effects on population
	dynamics of long-lived vertebrates but cohort effects have been poorly
	investigated in short-lived species.2. Cohort effects were quantified
	in the common lizard (Zootoca vivipara Jacquin 1787), a short-lived
	ectothermic vertebrate, for body size, reproductive traits and age-specific
	survival with mark-recapture data collected from 1989 to 2005 in
	two wetlands. We assessed cohort variation and covariation in demographic
	traits, tested the immediate and delayed effects of climate conditions
	(temperature and rainfall), and predicted consequences for population
	growth. 3. Most demographic traits exhibited cohort variation, but
	this variation was stronger for juvenile growth and survival, sub-adult
	survival and breeding phenology than for other traits. 4. Cohort
	variation was partly explained by a web of immediate and delayed
	effects of climate conditions. Rainfall and temperature influenced
	distinct life-history traits and the periods of gestation and early
	juvenile life were critical stages for climate effects. 5. Cohort
	covariation between demographic traits was usually weak, apart from
	a negative correlation between juvenile and sub-adult body growth
	suggesting compensatory responses. An age-structured population model
	shows that cohort variation influences population growth mainly through
	direct numerical effects of survival variation early in life. 6.
	An understanding of cohort effects is necessary to predict critical
	life stages and climatic determinants of population dynamics, and
	therefore demographic responses to future climate warming.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several studies have shown a relatively high mortality

	(H1N1) virus. Here we compared the age distributions of morbidity
	and mortality during two seasonal influenza epidemics (H1N1 and H3N2)
	in France and the United States with those of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic
	waves in the same countries. METHODS: Age-standardized ratios were
	used to compare the age distribution of morbidity and mortality due
	to influenza between the two countries and across the different years.
	Non parametric analysis of variance was used to compare these ratios
	between epidemic and pandemic influenza. RESULTS: Age distribution
	of morbidity was similar between the 2009 pandemic and seasonal epidemics
	due to H1N1 (p = 0.72) and H3N2 viruses (p = 0.68). In contrast,
	the proportion of under-60s among influenza deaths was markedly higher
	during the 2009 pandemic (peak <20 years) than during the seasonal

	We estimate the age- and cause-specific excess mortality impact of

	epidemic and pandemic seasons. METHODS: We applied Serfling and Poisson
	excess mortality approaches to model weekly age- and cause-specific

	in France, compared to rates per 100,000 of 44 (95\% CI 43-45) for
	the A/H3N2 pandemic and 2.9 (95\% CI 2.3-3.7) for average inter-pandemic
	seasons. The 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic had a 10.6-fold higher impact than
	inter-pandemic seasons in people aged 5-24 years and 3.8-fold lower
	impact among people over 65 years. CONCLUSIONS: The 2009 pandemic
	in France had low mortality impact in most age groups, relative to
	past influenza seasons, except in school-age children and young adults.
	The historical A/H3N2 pandemic was associated with much larger mortality
	impact than the 2009 pandemic, across all age groups and outcomes.
	Our 2009 pandemic excess mortality estimates for France fall within
	the range of previous estimates for high-income regions. Based on
	the analysis of several mortality outcomes and comparison with laboratory-confirmed
	2009/H1N1 deaths, we conclude that cardio-respiratory and all-cause
	mortality lack precision to accurately measure the impact of this
	pandemic in high-income settings and that use of more specific mortality
	outcomes is important to obtain reliable age-specific estimates},

	Abstract = {The phenotypic plasticity of traits, defined as the ability of a genotype
	to express different phenotypic values of the trait across a range
	of environments, can vary between habitats depending on levels of
	temporal and spatial heterogeneity. Other traits can be insensitive
	to environmental perturbations and show environmental canalization.
	We tested levels of phenotypic plasticity in diverse Drosophila serrata
	populations along a latitudinal cline ranging from a temperate, variable
	climate to a tropical, stable climate by measuring developmental
	rate and size-related traits at three temperatures (16 degrees C,
	22 degrees C, and 28 degrees C). We then compared the slopes of the
	thermal reaction norms among populations. The 16-22 degrees C part
	of the reaction norms for developmental rate was flatter (more canalized)
	for the temperate populations than for the tropical populations.
	However, slopes for the reaction norms of the two morphological traits
	(wing size, wing:thorax ratio), were steeper (more plastic) in the
	temperate versus the tropical populations over the entire thermal
	range. The different latitudinal patterns in plasticity for developmental
	rate and the morphological traits may reflect contrasting selection
	pressures along the tropical-temperate thermal gradient},

	Abstract = {Maturation age and size have important fitness consequences through
	their effects on survival probabilities and body sizes. The evolution
	of maturation reaction norms in response to environmental covariation
	in growth and mortality is therefore a key subject of life-history
	theory. The eco-evolutionary model we present and analyze here incorporates
	critical features that earlier studies of evolving maturation reaction
	norms have often neglected: the trade-off between growth and reproduction,
	source-sink population structure, and population regulation through
	density-dependent growth and fecundity. We report the following findings.
	First, the evolutionarily optimal age at maturation can be decomposed
	into the sum of a density-dependent and a density-independent component.
	These components measure, respectively, the hypothetical negative
	age at which an individual's length would be 0 and the delay in maturation
	relative to this offset. Second, along any growth trajectory, individuals
	mature earlier when mortality is higher. This allows us to deduce,
	third, how the shapes of evolutionarily optimal maturation reaction
	norms depend on the covariation between growth and mortality (positive
	or negative, linear or curvilinear, and deterministic or probabilistic).
	Providing eco-evolutionary explanations for many alternative reaction-norm
	shapes, our results appear to be in good agreement with current empirical
	knowledge on maturation dynamics.},

	Abstract = {Population-level effects of global warming result from concurrent
	direct and indirect processes. They are typically described by physiologically
	structured population models (PSPMs). Therefore, inverse modelling
	offers a tool to identify parameters of individual physiological
	processes through population-level data analysis, e.g. the temperature
	dependence of growth from size-frequency data of a field population.
	Here, we make use of experiments under laboratory conditions, in
	mesocosms and field monitoring to determine the temperature dependence
	of growth and mortality of Gammarus pulex. We found an optimum temperature
	for growth of approximately 17$\,^{\circ}$C and a related temperature
	coefficient, Q(10), of 1.5$\,^{\circ}$C(-1), irrespective of whether
	we classically fitted individual growth curves or applied inverse
	modelling based on PSPMs to laboratory data. From a comparison of
	underlying data sets we conclude that applying inverse modelling
	techniques to population-level data results in meaningful response
	parameters for physiological processes if additional temperature-driven
	effects, including within-population interaction, can be excluded
	or determined independently. If this is not the case, parameter estimates
	describe a cumulative response, e.g. comprising temperature-dependent
	resource dynamics. Finally, fluctuating temperatures in natural habitats
	increased the uncertainty in parameter values. Here, PSPM should
	be applied for virtual monitoring in order to determine a sampling
	scheme that comprises important dates to reduce parameter uncertainty},

	between successive environmental states can profoundly influence
	extinction has not been empirically validated. Identical clonal populations
	from a model experimental system based on the collembolan Folsomia
	candida were used in the present study to investigate the effect
	of environmental autocorrelation on time to extinction. Environmental
	variation was imposed by variable implementation (present/absent)
	of a culling procedure according to treatments that represented six
	patterns of environmental autocorrelation. The average number of
	culling events was held constant across treatments but, as environmental
	autocorrelation increased, longer runs of both favourable and unfavourable
	culling tended to occur. While no difference was found among the
	survival functions for the various treatments, the time taken for
	50\% of the component populations to become extinct decreased significantly
	with increasing environmental autocorrelation. Similarly, analysis
	of all extinct populations demonstrated that time to extinction was
	shortened as environmental autocorrelation increased. However, this
	acceleration of extinction can be fully offset if sequential introduction
	is used in place of simultaneous introduction when founding the populations.},

	Abstract = {Parental effects arise when either the maternal or paternal phenotype
	influences the phenotypes of subsequent generations. Simple analytical
	models assume maternal effects are a mechanism creating delayed density
	dependence. Such models predict that maternal effects can very easily
	lead to population cycles. Despite this, unambiguous maternal-effect
	mediated cycles have not been demonstrated in any system. Additionally,
	much evidence has arisen to invalidate the underlying assumption
	that there is a simple positive correlation between maternal performance
	and offspring performance. A key issue in understanding how maternal
	effects may affect population dynamics is determining how the expression
	of parental effects changes in different environments. In this study,
	we tested the hypothesis that maternal effects influence population
	dynamics in a context-dependent way. Populations of the soil mite,
	Sancassania berlesei, were set up at high density (500 eggs) or low
	density (50 eggs), with eggs that were either laid by young mothers
	or old mothers (a previously documented maternal effect in this system).
	The influence of maternal age on both population and egg and body-size
	dynamics was only observed in the populations initiated under low
	density rather than high density. This difference was attributable
	to the context-dependence of maternal effects at the individual level.
	In low-density (high food) conditions, maternal effects have an impact
	on offspring reproductive performance, creating an impact on the
	population growth rate. In high density (low food), maternal effects
	impact more on juvenile survival (not adult size or reproduction),
	creating a smaller impact on the population growth rate. This context
	dependence of effects at the population level means that, in fluctuating
	populations, maternal effects cause intermittent delayed density
	dependence that does not lead to persistent cycles.},

	Abstract = {In order to measure the genetic variability and determine the evolutionary
	relationships among strains of the parthenogenetic "standard" springtail.
	Folsomia candida, we used Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD-PCR)
	markers and determined the nucleotide sequence of the 18S and 28S
	rDNA genes. Both types of molecular characters were found to be polymorphic.
	We obtained phylogenetic trees using Direct Optimization in the dynamic
	homology paradigm. The trees were polarized with Isotoma viridis
	as an outgroup. All the trees based on one or the other type of molecular
	characters or based on all characters pooled together, support the
	hypothesis of an early divergence of two distinct lineages among
	the 11 strains of F candida under study. Our results also suggest
	that these lineages differ in their rate of evolution and mode of
	diversification. The geographical origin of the studied strains was
	examined but we found no clear relation between the phylogenetic
	relationships and probable geographical origins. The early divergence
	of several lineages in this species should be taken into account
	when comparing studies on genetically different strains of this model
	organism. RAPD-PCR typing is an easy and efficient toot for doing
	such a task. (c) 2005 Etsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},
