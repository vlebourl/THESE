@article{alvarez2005a,
	Abstract = {1. Hermaphroditic and gonochoric reproduction are essentially different
	reproductive strategies that may lead to diverging population responses
	to adverse environmental conditions. Each strategy implies different
	physiological mechanisms, which affect life-history traits and represent
	different ways of dealing with stress.
	
	2. We studied the performance of hermaphroditic vs gonochoric strains
	in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans exposed to cadmium stress
	at the individual and population level.
	
	3. Under control conditions, the gonochoric strain started reproduction
	earlier than the hermaphroditic strain at a smaller size. This was
	due to an earlier switch from sperm to oocyte production triggered
	by male sperm availability. Under cadmium stress hermaphrodites showed
	a decrease in the size at onset of reproduction, presumably as a
	strategy to maintain a high population growth rate. In contrast the
	body size of gonochoric nematodes was not affected.
	
	4. A process-based model (DEBtox) was used as a tool for analysing
	life-history data and calculating population growth rates. The model
	fitted the data well using physiologically relevant parameters such
	as ageing, survival or reproduction related parameters. The simultaneous
	fit of all life-history traits was used to obtain populations growth
	rate estimates.
	
	5. The differences between the two C. elegans strains were reflected
	at the population level. Lower population growth rates, as calculated
	by DEBtox, were found in the gonochoric strain, largely determined
	by the proportion of males in the offspring.
	
	6. From the overall results we suggest that the differences found
	between both populations are due to the reproductive strategy. Under
	control conditions, CB strain (with gonochoric reproduction) does
	not favour population growth rates in the short term due to faster
	ageing and copulation costs on survival. Furthermore, in response
	to stress this strain also showed lower performance than the N2 hermaphroditic
	strain, mainly due to a higher sensitivity of survival to the stressor.},

@article{amarasekare2002a,
	Abstract = {Interference competition is ubiquitous in nature. Yet its effects on resource exploitation remain largely unexplored for species that compete for dynamic resources. Here, I present a model of exploitative and interference competition with explicit resource dynamics. The model incorporates both biotic and abiotic resources. It considers interference competition both in the classical sense (i.e. each species suffers a net reduction in per capita growth rate via interference from, and interference on, the other species) and in the broad sense (i.e. each species suffers a net reduction in per capita growth rate via interference from, but can experience an increase in growth rate via interference on, the other species). Coexistence cannot occur under classical interference competition even when the species inferior at resource exploitation is superior at interference. Such a trade-off can, however, change the mechanism of competitive exclusion from dominance by the superior resource exploiter to a priority effect. Now the inferior resource exploiter can exclude the superior resource exploiter provided it has a higher initial abundance. By contrast, when interference is beneficial to the interacting species, coexistence is possible via a trade-off between exploitation and interference. These results hold regardless of whether the resource is biotic or abiotic, indicating that the outcome of exploitative and interference competition does not depend on the exact nature of resource dynamics. The model makes two key predictions. First, species that engage in costly interference mechanisms (e.g. territoriality, overgrowth or undercutting, allelopathy and other forms of chemical competition) should not be able to coexist unless they also engage in beneficial interference mechanisms (e.g. predation or parasitism). Second, exotic invasive species that displace native biota should be superior resource exploiters that have strong interference effects on native species with little or negative cost. The first prediction provides a potential explanation for patterns observed in several natural systems, including plants, aquatic invertebrates and insects. The second prediction is supported by data on invasive plants and vertebrates},

	Abstract = {In many organisms, individuals in colder environments grow more slowly
	but are larger as adults. This widespread pattern is embodied by
	two well-established rules: Bergmann's rule, which describes the
	association between temperature and body size in natural environments,
	and the temperature-size rule, which describes reaction norms relating
	temperature to body size in laboratory experiments. Theory predicts
	that organisms should grow to be larger in colder environments when
	growth efficiency decreases with increasing environmental temperature.
	Using data from 97 laboratory experiments, including 58 species of
	ectotherms, we found little evidence that growth efficiency is negatively
	related to environmental temperature within the thermal range that
	is relevant to the temperature-size rule. Instead, growth efficiency
	was either positively related or insensitive to environmental temperature
	in the majority of cases (73 of 89 cases for gross growth efficiency
	and 18 of 24 cases for net growth efficiency). Two possibilities
	merit consideration. First, high temperatures may impose constraints
	on growth that only arise late during ontogeny; this simple and potentially
	general explanation is supported by the fact that thermal optima
	for growth efficiency and growth rate decrease as individuals grow.
	Alternatively, the general explanation for relationships between
	temperature and body size may not be simple. If the latter view is
	correct, the best approach might be to generate and test theories
	that are tailored specifically to organisms with similar behavior
	and physiology.},

@article{arditi1989a,
	Abstract = {In continuous-time predator-prey models, the per capita rate of consumption (the functional response or trophic function) is usually interpreted as a behavioral phenomenon. The classical assumptions are that predators encounter prey at random and that the trophic function depends on prey abundance only. We argue that this approach is not always appropriate. The trophic function must be considered on the slow time scale of population dynamics at which the models operatenot on the fast behavioral time scale. We propose that, in cases where these two time scales differ, it is reasonable to assume that the trophic function depends on the ratio of prey to predator abundances. Several field and laboratory observations support this hypothesis. We compare the consequences of the two types of dependence with respect to the dynamical properties of the models and the responses of population equilibria to variations in primary production. In traditional prey-dependent models, only the predator population responds to primary production, while both levels respond in ratio-dependent models. This result is generalized to food chains. We suggest that the ratio-dependent form of the trophic function is a simple way of accounting for many types of heterogeneity that occur in large scale natural systems, while the prey-dependent form may be more appropriate for homogeneous systems like chemostats.},

	(ii) colour-coded segments depicting the level of repro- duction
	at each age; and (iii) a cohort survival schedule created by rank-ordering
	individual life lines from shortest- to longest-lived. 2. The resulting
	graphic, referred to as an event history diagram, portrays data at
	the individual level and thus allows visual comparisons of detailed
	life-history patterns such as age of first reproduction, longevity,
	ages of high, medium, low and zero repro- duction, and post-reproductive
	period. 3. Example graphs are shown for reproductive and longevity
	data gathered on 1000 medfly females. The average female lived 35·6
	days and laid 759·3 eggs and therefore the graphs display information
	for 35 600 fly days and the age-distribution of laying for 759 300
	eggs. 4. Because the graphics provide a means for visualizing large
	amounts of data precisely and efficiently, they reveal details and
	nuances in the data that are not apparent from conventional graphic
	methods. 5. The advantages of longitudinal data gathered on individuals
	and reasons why visualizing individual-level data is important are

	Abstract = {Although it is widely known that dietary restriction (DR) not only
	extends the longevity of a wide range of species but also reduces
	their reproductive output, the interrelationship of DR, longevity
	extension and reproduction is not well understood in any organism.
	Here we address the question: 'Under what nutritional conditions
	do the longevity-enhancing effects resulting from food restriction
	either counteract, complement or reinforce the mortality costs of
	reproduction? To answer this question we designed a fine-grained
	DR study involving 4800 individuals of the tephritid fruit fly, Anastrepha
	ludens, in which we measured sex-specific survival and daily reproduction
	in females in each of 20 different treatments (sugar : yeast ratios)
	plus 4 starvation controls. The database generated from this 3-year
	study consisted of approximately 100 000 life-days for each sex and
	750 000 eggs distributed over the reproductive lives of 2400 females.
	The fertility and longevity-extending responses were used to create
	contour maps (X-Y grid) that show the demographic responses (Z-axis)
	across dietary gradients that range from complete starvation to both
	ad libitum sugar-only and ad libitum standard diet (3 : 1 sugar :

	demographic thresholds related to both caloric content and sugar

	Abstract = {Demographic characteristics of the bacterial-feeding nematode Caenorhabditis
	elegans were determined in two long-lived mutant strains, TJ1052
	(age-1), CB4876 (clk-1), and a wild-type strain, N2. Within each
	strain, there was little correlation between longevity and reproduction
	for individuals that lived longer than 10 days. Long-lived mutant
	strains produced fewer eggs than the wild type. Mean total life spans
	were 13.2 days for the wild type, 21.9 days for age-1, and 15.8 days
	for clk-1; maximum life spans were 24 days for the wild type, 47
	days for age-1, and 32 days for clk-1. Differences in total life
	span resulted primarily from longer post-reproductive survival. The
	mean post-reproductive life spans were longer than the wild type
	by 183\% in age-1 and 60\% in clk-1. We conclude that (i) post-reproductive
	survival is not correlated with egg production within isogenic populations
	of C. elegans, and (ii) the relationship between reproduction and
	longevity differs among isogenic populations with specific longevity

@article{claessen2004a,
	Abstract = {Cannibalism is characterized by four aspects: killing victims, gaining energy from victims, size-dependent interactions and intraspecific competition. In this review of mathematical models of cannibalistic populations, we relate the predicted population dynamic consequences of cannibalism to its four defining aspects. We distinguish five classes of effects of cannibalism: (i) regulation of population size; (ii) destabilization resulting in population cycles or chaos; (iii) stabilization by damping population cycles caused by other interactions; (iv) bistability such that, depending on the initial conditions, the population converges to one of two possible stable states; and (v) modification of the population size structure. The same effects of cannibalism may be caused by different combinations of aspects of cannibalism. By contrast, the same combination of aspects may lead to different effects. For particular cannibalistic species, the consequences of cannibalism will depend on the presence and details of the four defining aspects. Empirical evidence for the emerged theory of cannibalism is discussed briefly. The implications of the described dynamic effects of cannibalism are discussed in the context of community structure, making a comparison with the community effects of intraguild predation},

You will need a basic knowledge of mathematical modeling but no familiarity with PSP models or the ensuing partial differential equations. My aim is to equip you with enough skills to be able to use moderately complex PSP models for specific biological applications. Hence, I emphasize the formulation of the models, the biological interpretation of the equations, and the tools for studying the models. The mathematical background of the modeling framework and the justification of the equations are discussed only when necessary for a better understanding of the biological aspects of the models.},

@article{de-roos2013a,
	Abstract = {Body size ( biomass) is the dominant determinant of population dynamical processes such as giving birth or dying in almost all species, with often drastically different behaviour occurring in different parts of the growth trajectory, while the latter is largely determined by food availability at the different life stages. This leads to the question under what conditions unstructured population models, formulated in terms of total population biomass, still do a fair job. To contribute to answering this question we first analyze the conditions under which a size-structured model collapses to a dynamically equivalent unstructured one in terms of total biomass. The only biologically meaningful case where this occurs is when body size does not affect any of the population dynamic processes, this is the case if and only if the mass-specific ingestion rate, the mass-specific biomass production and the mortality rate of the individuals are independent of size, a condition to which we refer as "ontogenetic symmetry". Intriguingly, under ontogenetic symmetry the equilibrium biomass-body size spectrum is proportional to 1/size, a form that has been conjectured for marine size spectra and subsequently has been used as prior assumption in theoretical papers dealing with the latter. As a next step we consider an archetypical class of models in which reproduction takes over from growth upon reaching an adult body size, in order to determine how quickly discrepancies from ontogenetic symmetry lead to relevant novel population dynamical phenomena. The phenomena considered are biomass overcompensation, when additional imposed mortality leads, rather unexpectedly, to an increase in the equilibrium biomass of either the juveniles or the adults (a phenomenon with potentially big consequences for predators of the species), and the occurrence of two types of size-structure driven oscillations, juvenile-driven cycles with separated extended cohorts, and adult-driven cycles in which periodically a front of relatively steeply decreasing frequencies moves up the size distribution. A small discrepancy from symmetry can already lead to biomass overcompensation; size-structure driven cycles only occur for somewhat larger discrepancies},

	Abstract = {Although the causes of population extinction are well understood,
	the speed at which populations decline to extinction is not. A testable,
	counter-intuitive prediction of stochastic population theory is that,
	on average, for any interior interval of the domain of biologically
	attainable population sizes, the expected duration of increase equals
	the expected duration of decline. Here we report the first empirical
	tests of this hypothesis. Using data from two experiments in which
	replicate populations of Daphnia magna were observed to go extinct
	under different experimental conditions, we failed to reject the
	null hypothesis of no difference between the growth and decline phases
	in populations under constant conditions and conditions with modest
	environmental variability, but find strong evidence to reject equal
	first passage time in highly variable environments. These results
	confirm the prediction of equal passage times entailed by diffusion
	models of population dynamics, supporting continued application in
	both population theory and conservation decision making under the
	restricted conditions where the approximation can be expected to
	hold.},

	Abstract = {Although nearly all organisms are subject to fluctuating temperature
	regimes in their natural habitat, little is known about the genetics
	underlying the response to thermal conditions, and even less about
	the genetic differences that cause individual variation in thermal
	response. Here, we aim to elucidate possible pathways involved in
	temperature-induced phenotypic plasticity of growth rate. Our model
	organism is the collembolan Orchesella cincta that occurs in a wide
	variety of habitats and is known to be adapted to local thermal conditions.
	Because sequence information is lacking in O. cincta, we constructed
	cDNA libraries enriched for temperature-responsive genes using suppression
	subtractive hybridization. We compared gene expression of O. cincta
	with steep thermal reaction norms (high plasticity) to those with
	flat thermal reaction norms (low plasticity) for juvenile growth
	after exposure to a temperature switch composed of a cooling or a
	warming treatment. Using suppression subtractive hybridization, we
	found differential expression of ten nuclear genes, including several
	genes involved in energy metabolism, such as pantothenate kinase
	and carbonic anhydrase. In addition, seven mitochondrial genes were
	found in the cloned subtracted library, but further analysis showed
	this was caused by allelic variation in mitochondrial genes in our
	founder population, and that a specific haplotype was associated
	with high thermal responsiveness. Future work will focus on candidate
	genes from pathways such as the oxidative phosphorylation and biosynthesis
	of coenzyme A which are possibly involved in thermal responsiveness
	of juvenile growth rate.},

	Abstract = {Increases in biodiversity can result from an increase in species richness,
	as well as from a higher genetic diversity within species. Intraspecific
	genetic diversity, measured as the number of genotypes, can enhance
	plant primary productivity and have cascading effects at higher trophic
	levels, such as an increase in herbivore and predator richness. The
	positive effects of genotypic mixtures are not only determined by
	additive effects, but also by interactions among genotypes, such
	as facilitation or inhibition. However, so far there has been no
	effort to predict the extent of such effects. In this study, we address
	the question of whether the magnitude of the effect of genotype number
	on population performance can be explained by the extent of dissimilarity
	in key traits among genotypes in a mixture. We examine the relative
	contribution of genotype number and phenotypic dissimilarity among
	genotypes to population performance of the soil arthropod, Orchesella
	cincta. Nearly homogeneous genotypes were created from inbred isofemale
	lines. Phenotypic dissimilarity among genotypes was assessed in terms
	of three life-history traits that are associated with population
	growth rate, i.e., egg size, egg development time, and juvenile growth
	rate. A microcosm experiment with genotype mixtures consisting of
	one, two, four, and eight genotypes, showed that genotypic richness
	strongly increased population size and biomass production and was
	associated with greater net diversity effects. Most importantly,
	there was a positive log-linear relationship between phenotypic dissimilarity
	in a mixture and the net diversity effects for juvenile population
	size and total biomass. In other words, the degree of phenotypic
	dissimilarity among genotypes determined the magnitude of the genotypic
	richness effect, although this relationship leveled off at higher
	values of phenotypic dissimilarity. Although the exact mechanisms
	responsible for these effects are currently unknown, similar advantages
	of trait dissimilarity have been found among species. Hence, to better
	understand population performance, genotype number and phenotypic
	dissimilarity should be considered collectively},

@article{fountain2005a,
	Abstract = {Folsomia candida Willem 1902, a member of the order Collembola (colloquially called springtails), is a common and widespread arthropod that occurs in soils throughout the world. The species is parthenogenetic and is easy to maintain in the laboratory on a diet of granulated dry yeast. F. candida has been used as a "standard" test organism for more than 40 years for estimating the effects of pesticides and environmental pollutants on nontarget soil arthropods. However, it has also been employed as a model for the investigation of numerous other phenomena such as cold tolerance, quality as a prey item, and effects of microarthropod grazing on pathogenic fungi and mycorrhizae of plant roots. In this comprehensive review, aspects of the life history, ecology, and ecotoxicology of F. candida are covered. We focus on the recent literature, especially studies that have examined the effects of soil pollutants on reproduction in F. candida using the protocol published by the International Standards Organization in 1999},

	Abstract = {A recently documented correlate of anthropogenic climate change involves
	reductions in body size, the nature and scale of the pattern leading
	to suggestions of a third universal response to climate warming.
	Because body size affects thermoregulation and energetics, changing
	body size has implications for resilience in the face of climate
	change. A review of recent studies shows heterogeneity in the magnitude
	and direction of size responses, exposing a need for large-scale
	phylogenetically controlled comparative analyses of temporal size
	change. Integrative analyses of museum data combined with new theoretical
	models of size-dependent thermoregulatory and metabolic responses
	will increase both understanding of the underlying mechanisms and
	physiological consequences of size shifts and, therefore, the ability
	to predict the sensitivities of species to climate change.},

	Abstract = {Calls to understand the links between ecology and evolution have been
	common for decades. Population dynamics, i.e. the demographic changes
	in populations, arise from life history decisions of individuals
	and thus are a product of selection, and selection, on the contrary,
	can be modified by such dynamical properties of the population as
	density and stability. It follows that generating predictions and
	testing them correctly requires considering this ecogenetic feedback
	loop whenever traits have demographic consequences, mediated via
	density dependence (or frequency dependence). This is not an easy
	challenge, and arguably theory has advanced at a greater pace than
	empirical research. However, theory would benefit from more interaction
	between related fields, as is evident in the many near-synonymous
	names that the ecogenetic loop has attracted. We also list encouraging
	examples where empiricists have shown feasible ways of addressing
	the question, ranging from advanced data analysis to experiments
	and comparative analyses of phylogenetic data.},

	Abstract = {P>1. Demographic theory and empirical studies indicate that cohort
	variation in demographic traits has substantial effects on population
	dynamics of long-lived vertebrates but cohort effects have been poorly
	investigated in short-lived species.2. Cohort effects were quantified
	in the common lizard (Zootoca vivipara Jacquin 1787), a short-lived
	ectothermic vertebrate, for body size, reproductive traits and age-specific
	survival with mark-recapture data collected from 1989 to 2005 in
	two wetlands. We assessed cohort variation and covariation in demographic
	traits, tested the immediate and delayed effects of climate conditions
	(temperature and rainfall), and predicted consequences for population
	growth. 3. Most demographic traits exhibited cohort variation, but
	this variation was stronger for juvenile growth and survival, sub-adult
	survival and breeding phenology than for other traits. 4. Cohort
	variation was partly explained by a web of immediate and delayed
	effects of climate conditions. Rainfall and temperature influenced
	distinct life-history traits and the periods of gestation and early
	juvenile life were critical stages for climate effects. 5. Cohort
	covariation between demographic traits was usually weak, apart from
	a negative correlation between juvenile and sub-adult body growth
	suggesting compensatory responses. An age-structured population model
	shows that cohort variation influences population growth mainly through
	direct numerical effects of survival variation early in life. 6.
	An understanding of cohort effects is necessary to predict critical
	life stages and climatic determinants of population dynamics, and
	therefore demographic responses to future climate warming.},

	and mortality during two seasonal influenza epidemics (H1N1 and H3N2)
	in France and the United States with those of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic
	waves in the same countries. METHODS: Age-standardized ratios were
	used to compare the age distribution of morbidity and mortality due
	to influenza between the two countries and across the different years.
	Non parametric analysis of variance was used to compare these ratios
	between epidemic and pandemic influenza. RESULTS: Age distribution
	of morbidity was similar between the 2009 pandemic and seasonal epidemics
	due to H1N1 (p = 0.72) and H3N2 viruses (p = 0.68). In contrast,
	the proportion of under-60s among influenza deaths was markedly higher
	during the 2009 pandemic (peak <20 years) than during the seasonal

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The mortality burden of the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic remains
	unclear in many countries due to delays in reporting of death statistics.
	We estimate the age- and cause-specific excess mortality impact of
	the pandemic in France, relative to that of other countries and past
	epidemic and pandemic seasons. METHODS: We applied Serfling and Poisson
	excess mortality approaches to model weekly age- and cause-specific
	mortality rates from June 1969 through May 2010 in France. Indicators
	of influenza activity, time trends, and seasonal terms were included
	in the models. We also reviewed the literature for country-specific
	estimates of 2009 pandemic excess mortality rates to characterize
	geographical differences in the burden of this pandemic. RESULTS:
	The 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic was associated with 1.0 (95\% Confidence
	Intervals (CI) 0.2-1.9) excess respiratory deaths per 100,000 population
	in France, compared to rates per 100,000 of 44 (95\% CI 43-45) for
	the A/H3N2 pandemic and 2.9 (95\% CI 2.3-3.7) for average inter-pandemic
	seasons. The 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic had a 10.6-fold higher impact than
	inter-pandemic seasons in people aged 5-24 years and 3.8-fold lower
	impact among people over 65 years. CONCLUSIONS: The 2009 pandemic
	in France had low mortality impact in most age groups, relative to
	past influenza seasons, except in school-age children and young adults.
	The historical A/H3N2 pandemic was associated with much larger mortality
	impact than the 2009 pandemic, across all age groups and outcomes.
	Our 2009 pandemic excess mortality estimates for France fall within
	the range of previous estimates for high-income regions. Based on
	the analysis of several mortality outcomes and comparison with laboratory-confirmed
	2009/H1N1 deaths, we conclude that cardio-respiratory and all-cause
	mortality lack precision to accurately measure the impact of this
	pandemic in high-income settings and that use of more specific mortality
	outcomes is important to obtain reliable age-specific estimates},

	Abstract = {The phenotypic plasticity of traits, defined as the ability of a genotype
	to express different phenotypic values of the trait across a range
	of environments, can vary between habitats depending on levels of
	temporal and spatial heterogeneity. Other traits can be insensitive
	to environmental perturbations and show environmental canalization.
	We tested levels of phenotypic plasticity in diverse Drosophila serrata
	populations along a latitudinal cline ranging from a temperate, variable
	climate to a tropical, stable climate by measuring developmental
	rate and size-related traits at three temperatures (16 degrees C,
	22 degrees C, and 28 degrees C). We then compared the slopes of the
	thermal reaction norms among populations. The 16-22 degrees C part
	of the reaction norms for developmental rate was flatter (more canalized)
	for the temperate populations than for the tropical populations.
	However, slopes for the reaction norms of the two morphological traits
	(wing size, wing:thorax ratio), were steeper (more plastic) in the
	temperate versus the tropical populations over the entire thermal
	range. The different latitudinal patterns in plasticity for developmental
	rate and the morphological traits may reflect contrasting selection
	pressures along the tropical-temperate thermal gradient},

	Abstract = {1. Because of recent technological improvements in the way computer and digital camera perform, the potential use of imaging for contributing to the study of communities, populations or individuals in laboratory microcosms has risen enormously. However its limited use is due to difficulties in the automation of image analysis. 2. We present an accurate and flexible method of image analysis for detecting, counting and measuring moving particles on a fixed but heterogeneous substrate. This method has been specifically designed to follow individuals, or entire populations, in experimental laboratory microcosms. It can be used in other applications. 3. The method consists in comparing multiple pictures of the same experimental microcosm in order to generate an image of the fixed background. This background is then used to extract, measure and count the moving organisms, leaving out the fixed background and the motionless or dead individuals. 4. We provide different examples (springtails, ants, nematodes, daphnia) to show that this non intrusive method is efficient at detecting organisms under a wide variety of conditions even on faintly contrasted and heterogeneous substrates. 5. The repeatability and reliability of this method has been assessed using experimental populations of the Collembola Folsomia candida. 6. We present an ImageJ plugin to automate the analysis of digital pictures of laboratory microcosms. The plugin automates the successive steps of the analysis and recursively analyses multiple sets of images, rapidly producing measurements from a large number of replicated microcosms},

	Abstract = {Maturation age and size have important fitness consequences through
	their effects on survival probabilities and body sizes. The evolution
	of maturation reaction norms in response to environmental covariation
	in growth and mortality is therefore a key subject of life-history
	theory. The eco-evolutionary model we present and analyze here incorporates
	critical features that earlier studies of evolving maturation reaction
	norms have often neglected: the trade-off between growth and reproduction,
	source-sink population structure, and population regulation through
	density-dependent growth and fecundity. We report the following findings.
	First, the evolutionarily optimal age at maturation can be decomposed
	into the sum of a density-dependent and a density-independent component.
	These components measure, respectively, the hypothetical negative
	age at which an individual's length would be 0 and the delay in maturation
	relative to this offset. Second, along any growth trajectory, individuals
	mature earlier when mortality is higher. This allows us to deduce,
	third, how the shapes of evolutionarily optimal maturation reaction
	norms depend on the covariation between growth and mortality (positive
	or negative, linear or curvilinear, and deterministic or probabilistic).
	Providing eco-evolutionary explanations for many alternative reaction-norm
	shapes, our results appear to be in good agreement with current empirical
	knowledge on maturation dynamics.},

@article{mccormick2012a,
	Abstract = {Competition is often most intense between similar sized organisms that have similar ecological requirements. Many coral reef fish species settle preferentially to live coral at the end of their larval phase where they interact with other species that recruited to the same habitat patch at a similar time. Mortality is high and usually selective and individuals must compete for low risk space. This study examined the competitive interactions between two species of juvenile damselfish and the extent to which interactions that occurred within a recruitment cohort established the disjunct distribution patterns that were displayed in later life stages. Censuses and field experiments with juveniles found that one species, the ambon damsel, was dominant immediately after settlement and pushed the subordinate species higher up the reef and further from shelter. Presence of a competitor resulted in reduced growth for both species. Juvenile size was the best predictor of competitive success and outweighed the effects of short term prior residency. Size at settlement also dramatically influenced survival, with slightly larger individuals displaying higher aggression, pushing the subordinate species into higher risk habitats. While subordinates had higher feeding rates, they also sustained higher mortality. The study highlights the importance of interaction dynamics between species within a recruitment cohort to patterns of growth and distribution of species within communities},

	Abstract = {Population-level effects of global warming result from concurrent
	direct and indirect processes. They are typically described by physiologically
	structured population models (PSPMs). Therefore, inverse modelling
	offers a tool to identify parameters of individual physiological
	processes through population-level data analysis, e.g. the temperature
	dependence of growth from size-frequency data of a field population.
	Here, we make use of experiments under laboratory conditions, in
	mesocosms and field monitoring to determine the temperature dependence
	of growth and mortality of Gammarus pulex. We found an optimum temperature
	for growth of approximately 17$\,^{\circ}$C and a related temperature
	coefficient, Q(10), of 1.5$\,^{\circ}$C(-1), irrespective of whether
	we classically fitted individual growth curves or applied inverse
	modelling based on PSPMs to laboratory data. From a comparison of
	underlying data sets we conclude that applying inverse modelling
	techniques to population-level data results in meaningful response
	parameters for physiological processes if additional temperature-driven
	effects, including within-population interaction, can be excluded
	or determined independently. If this is not the case, parameter estimates
	describe a cumulative response, e.g. comprising temperature-dependent
	resource dynamics. Finally, fluctuating temperatures in natural habitats
	increased the uncertainty in parameter values. Here, PSPM should
	be applied for virtual monitoring in order to determine a sampling
	scheme that comprises important dates to reduce parameter uncertainty},

	Abstract = {Environmental change, including climate change, can cause rapid phenotypic
	change via both ecological and evolutionary processes. Because ecological
	and evolutionary dynamics are intimately linked, a major challenge
	is to identify their relative roles. We exactly decomposed the change
	in mean body weight in a free-living population of Soay sheep into
	all the processes that contribute to change. Ecological processes
	contribute most, with selection---the underpinning of adaptive evolution---explaining
	little of the observed phenotypic trend. Our results enable us to
	explain why selection has so little effect even though weight is
	heritable, and why environmental change has caused a decline in the
	body size of Soay sheep.},

	Abstract = {Despite its significance regarding the conservation and management
	of biological resources, the body of theory predicting that the correlation
	between successive environmental states can profoundly influence
	extinction has not been empirically validated. Identical clonal populations
	from a model experimental system based on the collembolan Folsomia
	candida were used in the present study to investigate the effect
	of environmental autocorrelation on time to extinction. Environmental
	variation was imposed by variable implementation (present/absent)
	of a culling procedure according to treatments that represented six
	patterns of environmental autocorrelation. The average number of
	culling events was held constant across treatments but, as environmental
	autocorrelation increased, longer runs of both favourable and unfavourable
	culling tended to occur. While no difference was found among the
	survival functions for the various treatments, the time taken for
	50\% of the component populations to become extinct decreased significantly
	with increasing environmental autocorrelation. Similarly, analysis
	of all extinct populations demonstrated that time to extinction was
	shortened as environmental autocorrelation increased. However, this
	acceleration of extinction can be fully offset if sequential introduction
	is used in place of simultaneous introduction when founding the populations.},

@article{plaistow2009a,
	Abstract = {Parental effects arise when either the maternal or paternal phenotype
	influences the phenotypes of subsequent generations. Simple analytical
	models assume maternal effects are a mechanism creating delayed density
	dependence. Such models predict that maternal effects can very easily
	lead to population cycles. Despite this, unambiguous maternal-effect
	mediated cycles have not been demonstrated in any system. Additionally,
	much evidence has arisen to invalidate the underlying assumption
	that there is a simple positive correlation between maternal performance
	and offspring performance. A key issue in understanding how maternal
	effects may affect population dynamics is determining how the expression
	of parental effects changes in different environments. In this study,
	we tested the hypothesis that maternal effects influence population
	dynamics in a context-dependent way. Populations of the soil mite,
	Sancassania berlesei, were set up at high density (500 eggs) or low
	density (50 eggs), with eggs that were either laid by young mothers
	or old mothers (a previously documented maternal effect in this system).
	The influence of maternal age on both population and egg and body-size
	dynamics was only observed in the populations initiated under low
	density rather than high density. This difference was attributable
	to the context-dependence of maternal effects at the individual level.
	In low-density (high food) conditions, maternal effects have an impact
	on offspring reproductive performance, creating an impact on the
	population growth rate. In high density (low food), maternal effects
	impact more on juvenile survival (not adult size or reproduction),
	creating a smaller impact on the population growth rate. This context
	dependence of effects at the population level means that, in fluctuating
	populations, maternal effects cause intermittent delayed density
	dependence that does not lead to persistent cycles.},

	markers and determined the nucleotide sequence of the 18S and 28S
	rDNA genes. Both types of molecular characters were found to be polymorphic.
	We obtained phylogenetic trees using Direct Optimization in the dynamic
	homology paradigm. The trees were polarized with Isotoma viridis
	as an outgroup. All the trees based on one or the other type of molecular
	characters or based on all characters pooled together, support the
	hypothesis of an early divergence of two distinct lineages among
	the 11 strains of F candida under study. Our results also suggest
	that these lineages differ in their rate of evolution and mode of
	diversification. The geographical origin of the studied strains was
	examined but we found no clear relation between the phylogenetic
	relationships and probable geographical origins. The early divergence
	of several lineages in this species should be taken into account
	when comparing studies on genetically different strains of this model
	organism. RAPD-PCR typing is an easy and efficient toot for doing
	such a task. (c) 2005 Etsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {In a variable yet predictable world, organisms may use environmental cues to make adaptive adjustments to their phenotype. Such phenotypic flexibility is expected commonly to evolve in life history traits, which are closely tied to Darwinian fitness. Yet adaptive life history flexibility remains poorly documented. Here we introduce the collembolan Folsomia candida, a soil-dweller, parthenogenetic (all-female) microarthropod, as a model organism to study the phenotypic expression, genetic variation, fitness consequences and long-term evolution of life history flexibility. We demonstrate that collembola have a remarkable adaptive ability for adjusting their reproductive phenotype: when transferred from harsh to good conditions (in terms of food ration and crowding), a mother can fine-tune the number and the size of her eggs from one clutch to the next. The comparative analysis of eleven clonal populations of worldwide origins reveals (i) genetic variation in mean egg size under both good and bad conditions; (ii) no genetic variation in egg size flexibility, consistent with convergent evolution to a common physiological limit; (iii) genetic variation of both mean reproductive investment and reproductive investment flexibility, associated with a reversal of the genetic correlation between egg size and clutch size between environmental conditions ; (iv) a negative genetic correlation between reproductive investment flexibility and adult lifespan. Phylogenetic reconstruction shows that two life history strategies, called HIFLEX and LOFLEX, evolved early in evolutionary history. HIFLEX includes six of our 11 clones, and is characterized by large mean egg size and reproductive investment, high reproductive investment flexibility, and low adult survival. LOFLEX (the other five clones) has small mean egg size and low reproductive investment, low reproductive investment flexibility, and high adult survival. The divergence of HIFLEX and LOFLEX could represent different adaptations to environments differing in mean quality and variability, or indicate that a genetic polymorphism of reproductive investment reaction norms has evolved under a physiological tradeoff between reproductive investment flexibility and adult lifespan},

	Abstract = {Old-age survival has increased substantially since 1950. Death rates
	decelerate with age for insects, worms, and yeast, as well as humans.
	This evidence of extended postreproductive survival is puzzling.
	Three biodemographic insights--concerning the correlation of death
	rates across age, individual differences in survival chances, and
	induced alterations in age patterns of fertility and mortality--offer
	clues and suggest research on the failure of complicated systems,
	on new demographic equations for evolutionary theory, and on fertility-longevity
	interactions. Nongenetic changes account for increases in human life-spans
	to date. Explication of these causes and the genetic license for
	extended survival, as well as discovery of genes and other survival
	attributes affecting longevity, will lead to even longer lives.},

Size-specific mortality rates were computed from size-specific survivorship data. The results reveal an asymmetrically U-shaped mortality pattern, with disproportionally high juvenile mortality. The pattern changes from one generation to the next, in particular the post-hatching mortality. Evidence from behavioural ecological research on a Collembola-specialized ground beetle is cited in favour of the hypothesis that size-specific mortality patterns are moulded by size-specific predation.},

Because physiological rates are temperature sensitive, an ectotherm's behavioural and ecological performance -- even its fitness -- can be influenced by body temperature. As a result, the thermal sensitivity of ectotherm performance is relevant to diverse issues in physiology, ecology and evolution. This review formalizes an emerging framework for investigating the evolution of thermal sensitivity, outlines some functional and genetical constraints on that evolution, and summarizes comparative and experimental advances in this field.},

@article{worner1992a,
	Abstract = {Published research concerning insect development rate or phenology models shows that the effect of fluctuating temperature and rate summation on nonlinear and linear model predictions is not well understood. Models of rates of development at constant temperatures of an example insect are compared graphically with predicted rates under artificial and naturally varying temperature regimes. Acceleration of insect development at low temperatures and retardation at high temperatures are shown to be implicit to the assumption of nonlinearity of development. The influence of the diurnal range of the temperature regime on the rate summation effect and the interaction between rate summation and the mathematical structure of a particular development rate model are clearly demonstrated. This study shows that the selection of a development rate function for prescriptive use, based on closeness of fit to developmental data from constant temperature experiments, is meaningless. Nor should selection be based on how well a model derived from constant temperature experiments predicts insect development measured under a narrow range of fluctuating temperatures. Reasons why a nonlinear model fitted directly to rates observed under variable temperature laboratory or field data is inappropriate for subsequent prediction (in theory at least), are clearly demonstrated. An appropriate technique that calculates instantaneous development rate functions from fluctuating temperature development time observations is tested with hypothetical data. This technique failed to give reasonable estimates of the parameters of the instantaneous development rate function that generated the hypothetical data.},

	Abstract = {This paper deals with the influence of temperature on the development, survival, and reproduction of the pine shoot beetle, Tomicus piniperda (L.) at 5 constant temperatures from 10-30 degrees C. The threshold temperature and the endurance of the beetle to minimum and maximum temperature were also studied. The development time of egg, larval, pupa decreased with temperature from 10 to 30 degrees C. For these stages the threshold temperatures were calculated to be about 8.23, 7.2, 7.85 degrees C, and the effective heat sum required for finishing the developments were 95.8, 358.12, 115.87 D (day-degree) respectively. The survival rate reached maximum at 20-25 degrees C, and decreased at higher or lower temperature. The pine shoot beetle can survive at the low temperature of -5 degrees C, but can not survive when temperature is higher than 35 degrees C. The egg number reproduced by one female a day increased with temperature from 10 to 25 degrees C, and at 25 degrees C it was about 6.},

Its oxygen consumption was measured with a Gilson Differential Respirometer at 18 degrees C, 20 degrees C, 22 degrees C, and 24 degrees C and 18, 22, and 26 parts per thousand salinity. Lowest oxygen consumption occurred at the salinity-temperature (S-T) combination used to culture the aquarium population, 20 degrees C and 22 parts per thousand S.

	Abstract = {Our approach is twofold. First, with 1964-1983 data on red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris) in 11 provinces in Finland we show that population fluctuations in different parts of the country are largely synchronous. Second, using two differing model types for producing the dynamics of populations we set up to examine the synchronizing effect of an extrinsic disturbing factor, the Moran effect. We show that in a spatially structured population system a randomly occurring stochastic perturbation reducing reproduction success is indeed capable of synchronizing subpopulations. The synchronizing effect is achievable with a wide range of probabilities of occurrence and strengths. However, when the Moran effect occurs in most years its synchronizing power wanes, despite the strength of the effect. Allowing regionality in the variance of the strength of the Moran effect reduces the synchronizing capacity of the perturbation. The Moran effect is also capable of producing a wide range of population dynamics from very simple premises.},

	Abstract = {Concern regarding the ecological impact of rapid global warming has encouraged research on climate-induced changes in biological systems. Critical problems, still poorly understood, are the potential for rapid adaptive responses and their genetic costs to populations. The O chromosomal polymorphisms of Drosophila subobscura have been monitored at a southern Palearctic locality experiencing sustained climate warming since the mid-1970s. Observations suggest that the population is rapidly evolving in response to the new environmental conditions, and has lost a significant amount of chromosomal diversity (18.3\textbackslash\% in 16 years). These findings are consistent with results from another population of D. subobscura, which is also undergoing climate warming, and are in accord with what would be expected from latitudinal and seasonal patterns of the various inversions. In addition, data on the O chromosomal polymorphisms from other localities throughout t he range of this species suggest that other populations vary similarly.},

Population change from year to year is shown to be largely density-independent. 3. Analyses of meteorological records over the 37-year period showed that the weather variable with the highest correlation with population change was mean minimum temperature in September. 4. A simple model was constructed relating numerical changes from 1961 to 1992 to temperature, and this was found to explain 75\% of the change in this population. 5. The model was used to predict numerical change from 1993 to 1997 over which period it explained 70\% of the change. 6. The model predicts that a projected rise in mean temperature of 1 degrees C would increase the mean population density of N. lineatus by 50\%. 7. Experimental cloches at the upland site which raised mean temperature by 1 degrees C, had N. lineatus densities which were 157\% higher than in adjacent control quadrats. 8. An experimental raising of field temperature at a lowland site where population change had been shown to be density dependent did not result in density changes, although dates of hatching were earlier.},

@article{case2000a,
	Abstract = {Darwin viewed species range limits as chiefly determined by an interplay between the abiotic environment and interspecific interactions. Haldane argued that species' ranges could be set intraspecifically when gene flow from a species' populous center overwhelms local adaptation at the periphery. Recently, Kirkpatrick and Barton have modeled Haldane's process with a quantitative genetic model that combines density-dependent local population growth with dispersal and gene flow across a linear environmental gradient in optimum phenotype. To address Darwin's ideas, we have extended the Kirkpatrick and Barton model to include interspecific competition and the frequency-dependent selection that it generates, as well as stabilizing selection on a quantitative character. Our model includes local population growth, movements over space, natural selection, and gene flow. It simultaneously addresses the evolution of character displacement and species borders. It reproduces the Kirkpatrick and Barton single-species result that limited ranges can be produced with sufficiently steep environmental gradients and strong dispersal. Further, in the absence of environmental gradients or barriers to dispersal, interspecific competition will not limit species ranges at evolutionary equilibrium. However, interspecific competition can interact with environmental gradients and gene flow to generate limited ranges with much less extreme gradient and dispersal parameters than in the single-species case. Species display character displacement in sympatry, yet the reduction in competition that results from this displacement does not necessarily allow the two species to become sympatric everywhere. When species meet, competition reduces population densities in the region of overlap, which, in turn, intensifies the asymmetry in gene flow from center to margin. This reduces the ability of each species to adapt to local physical conditions at their range limits. If environmental gradients are monotonic but not linear, the transition zone between species at coevolutionary equilibrium occurs where the environmental gradient is steepest. If productivity gradients are also introduced into the model, then patterns similar to Rapoport's rule emerge. Interacting species respond to climate change, as it affects the optimal phenotype over space, by a combination of range shifts and local evolution in mean phenotype, while solitary species respond solely by range shifts. Finally, we compare empirical estimates for intrinsic growth rates and diffusion coefficients for several species to those needed by the single-species model to produce a stable limited range. These empirical values are generally insufficient to produce limited ranges in the model suggesting a role for interspecific interactions.},

It has already been found that a discontinuous transition to extinction is a necessary condition for suicide. Here we present necessary and sufficient conditions, concerning the bifurcation point, for suicide to occur. Evolutionary suicide has been found in structured metapopulation models. Here we show that suicide can occur also in unstructured population models. Moreover, a structured model does not guarantee the possibility of suicide: we show that suicide cannot occur in age-structured population models of the Gurtin-MacCamy type. The point is that the mutant's fitness must explicitly depend not only on the environmental interaction variable, but also on the resident strategy.},

	Abstract = {Genotype-by-temperature interaction is a necessary condition for adaptive evolution of fitness traits as a response to temperature. Several fitness-related traits (developmental time, pre-adult survival, thorax and wing lengths, and wing loading) were measured in laboratory-reared D. buzzatii from four populations sampled at different altitudes in north-western Argentina: a lowland population (407 m a.s.l.), two populations from intermediate altitude (780 to 950 in a.s.l.), and a highland population (2380 in a.s.l.). Temperature is the main climatic difference between the collection sites: lowland but not highland populations are exposed to physiologically high temperatures during both spring and summer in nature. Three growth temperatures (20, 25 and 30degreesC) were used to test for population-by-temperature interactions. Both developmental time and pre-adult survival exhibit highly significant population-by-temperature interaction. Preadult Survival at 30degreesC is significantly higher in lowland than in highland populations, but not so at lower growth temperatures (20 and 25degreesC). Both wing length and wing loading show no population-by-temperature interaction, indicating that these traits are not the direct targets of thermal adaptation in nature. Wing loading is higher in highland than in lowland populations, suggesting that flight performance is subject to stronger selection in the highland population. This hypothesis is consistent with ecological observations in both types of populations. There is no obvious among-population relationship between developmental time and body size, even though both traits are related within populations in a well-known trade-off. Overall, thermal adaptation is evident for developmental time and pre-adult survival but not for size-related traits.},

@article{ferguson2002a,
	Abstract = {1. Ecological theory suggests that density-dependent regulation of organism abundance will vary from exogenous to endogenous factors depending on trophic structure. Changes in abundance of soil arthropods were investigated at three trophic levels, springtails (Collembola), predaceous mites (Acari), and macro-arthropods (spider, adult and larval beetles, centipedes). Predictions were that springtails are predator regulated and mites are food limited according to the Hairston et al . (1960) model, which predicts alternating regulation by competition and predation from fungi to springtails to mites to macro-arthropods. The alternate hypothesis was based on the bottom-up model of trophic dynamics, which predicts that each trophic level is regulated by competition for resources. 2. The relative contributions to springtail and mite population dynamics of endogenous (i.e. density-dependent population growth related to food availability) and exogenous (i.e. predation and weather) factors were tested using time-series analysis and experimental manipulation of water conditions. Box patterns were distributed within an aspen forest habitat located in the Canadian prairies and surveyed weekly from May to September 1997-1999. Each box depressed the leaf litter, creating a microhabitat island for soil arthropods that provided counts of invertebrates located immediately beneath the boxes. 3. Strong evidence was found for endogenous control of springtail and mite numbers, indicated by a reduction in population growth related to density in the previous week. Contrary to predictions, no evidence was found for regulation of springtail numbers by mites, or for regulation of mite numbers by macro-arthropods. Springtail population growth rate was related positively to current springtail density (8 and 23\% variation explained) and related negatively to 1-week lagged density (85 and 58\%), and related negatively to temperature (5 and 5\%) for time-series data and for experimental addition of water respectively. Mite population growth rate was related positively to current mite density (54\%) and temperature (4\%), and negatively to 1-week lagged mite density (20\%) and precipitation (6\%) for time-series analysis. For experimental addition of water, mite growth rate was related positively to current mite density (44\%) and temperature (5\%), and negatively to 1-week lagged density (11\%). Results differed from the Hairston et al. (1960) model predictions but were consistent with a bottom-up view that springtail and mite populations were regulated intrinsically by competition for food and secondarily by temperature as a function of reproduction.},

	Abstract = {Temperature variation is an important factor in Everglade wetlands ecology. A temperature fluctuation from 17degreesC to 32degreesC recorded in the Everglades may have significant impact on fish dynamics. The short life cycles of some of Everglade fishes has rendered this temperature variation to have even more impacts on the ecosystem. Fish population dynamic models, which do not explicitly consider seasonal oscillations in temperature, may fail to describe the details of such a population. Hence, a model for fish in freshwater marshes of the Florida Everglades that explicitly incorporates seasonal temperature variations is developed. The model's main objective is to assess the temporal pattern of fish population and densities through time subject to temperature variations. Fish population is divided into 2 functional groups (FGs) consisting of small fishes; each group is subdivided into 5-day age classes during their life cycles. Many governing sub-modules are set directly or indirectly to be temperature dependent. Growth, fecundity, prey availability, consumption rates and mortality are examples. Several mortality sub-modules are introduced in the model, of which starvation mortality is set to be proportional to the ratio of prey needed to prey available at that particular time step. As part of the calibration process, the model is run for 50 years to ensure that fish densities do not go to extinction, while the simulation period is about 8 years. The model shows that the temperature dependent starvation mortality is an important factor that influences fish population densities. It also shows high fish population densities at some temperature ranges when this consumption need is minimum. Several sensitivity analyses involving variations in temperature terms, food resources and water levels are conducted to ascertain the relative importance of temperature dependence terms.},

@article{doebeli2003a,
	Abstract = {Traditional discussions of speciation are based on geographical patterns of species ranges. In allopatric speciation, long-term geographical isolation generates reproductively isolated and spatially segregated descendant species. In the absence of geographical barriers, diversification is hindered by gene flow. Yet a growing body of phylogenetic and experimental data suggests that closely related species often occur in sympatry or have adjacent ranges in regions over which environmental changes are gradual and do not prevent gene flow. Theory has identified a variety of evolutionary processes that can result in speciation under sympatric conditions, with some recent advances concentrating on the phenomenon of evolutionary branching. Here we establish a link between geographical patterns and ecological processes of speciation by studying evolutionary branching in spatially structured populations. We show that along an environmental gradient, evolutionary branching can occur much more easily than in non-spatial models. This facilitation is most pronounced for gradients of intermediate slope. Moreover, spatial evolutionary branching readily generates patterns of spatial segregation and abutment between the emerging species. Our results highlight the importance of local processes of adaptive divergence for geographical patterns of speciation, and caution against pitfalls of inferring past speciation processes from present biogeographical patterns.},

@article{crozier2003a,
	Abstract = {Our ability to predict ecological and evolutionary responses to climate change requires an understanding of the mechanistic links between climate and range limits. The warming trend over the past half-century has generated numerous opportunities to develop much-needed case studies of these links. Species that are only limited by climatic factors are likely to shift range quickly during periods of warming. Such species directly impact recipient communities and indicate trends that will become more widespread. Because minimum temperature (T (min)) is rising at twice the rate of maximum temperature, species with this range-limiting factor may be especially responsive to global warming. In this study, I test the hypothesis that rising T (min) has directly affected the range of a skipper butterfly. Atalopedes campestris has moved northward rapidly this century, recently colonizing eastern Washington where January T (min) has risen 3 degrees C in 50 years. The results show that: 1. A. campestris' range lies completely within the -4 degrees C January average minimum isotherm, and that recently colonized areas were below this threshold earlier this century. 2. In acute cold stress experiments, -4 to -7 degrees C proved to be a critical thermal limit: median supercooling point was -6.3 degrees C, and minimum lethal temperature (LT50 with 12-h exposure) was -5.7 degrees C. 3. In chronic cold stress experiments, survivorship declined sharply in diurnally fluctuating thermal regimes typical of the current range edge. High mortality occurred under constant 0 degrees C conditions as well as in fluctuating regimes, implying that thermal insulation from snow would not protect A. campestris. 4. There was no evidence of evolution in cold tolerance at the range margin, despite strong selection. Thus, winter warming was apparently a prerequisite for the range expansion. Characteristics of this species that seem to be associated with its rapid response are that it is an opportunistic species, it is not habitat or dispersal limited, and it is constrained by T (min).},

	Abstract = {Spring temperatures in temperate regions have increased over the past 20 years and many organisms have responded to this increase by advancing the timing of their growth and reproduction. However, not all populations show an advancement of phenology. Understanding why some populations advance and others do not will give us insight into the possible constraints and selection pressures on the advancement of phenology. By combining two decades of data on 24 populations of tits (Parus sp.) from six European countries, we show that the phenological response to large-scale changes in spring temperature varies across a species' range, even between populations situated close to each other. We show that this variation cannot be fully explained by variation in the temperature change during the pre- and post-laying periods, as recently suggested. Instead, we find evidence for a link between rising temperatures and the frequency of second broods, which results in complex shifts in the laying dates of first clutches. Our results emphasize the need to consider links between different life-history parameters in order to predict the ecological consequences of large-scale climate changes.},

	Abstract = {Adaptations to the cold and to short growing seasons characterize arctic life, but climate in the Arctic is warming at an unprecedented rate. Will plant and animal populations of the Arctic be able to cope with these drastic changes in environmental conditions? Here we explore the potential contribution of evolution by natural selection to the current response of populations to climate change. We focus on the spring phenology of populations because it is highly responsive to climate change and easy to document across a wide range of species. We show that evolution can be fast and can occur at the time scale of a few decades. We present an example of reproductive phenological change associated with climate change (North American red squirrels in the Yukon), where a detailed analysis of quantitative genetic parameters demonstrates contemporary evolution. We answer a series of frequently asked questions that should help biologists less familiar with evolutionary theory and quantitative genetic methods to think about the role of evolution in current responses of ecological systems to climate change. Our conclusion is that evolution by natural selection is a pertinent force to consider even at the time scale of contemporary climate changes. However, all species may not be equal in their capacity to benefit from contemporary evolution.},

	Abstract = {Relationships between temperature and preoviposition, preeclosion, and premolt developmental periods for the tick Ixodes scapularis Say were investigated by holding field-collected ticks in the laboratory at temperatures of 0 to 32degreesC at constant daylength. The duration of these developmental periods decreased significantly with increasing temperature. Host of origin, prior storage at 4degreesC, and season of collection of the ticks were also significantly associated with variations in the duration of the preoviposition period. For each developmental stage, the effect of temperature on development rate was best described as a power relationship. Laboratory-derived relationships were used to predict dates for molting, oviposition, and eclosion of engorged larvae and nymphs, engorged adult females and egg masses, respectively, placed in the field during 1989-1992. Predicted dates for oviposition by adult females, eclosion of eggs, and molting of engorged larvae were within 2 wk of the observed dates, and field-observed seasonal activity of questing larvae and nymphs also was predicted well by laboratory data. Molting of engorged nymphs and seasonal activity of questing adult ticks were, however, poorly predicted. Our findings suggest that duration of development in the field, of larvae from engorged adult females, and of nymphs from engorged larvae, may be explained largely by temperature effects alone, whereas emergence of adult I. scapularis from engorged nymphs may depend on temperature-independent diapause phenomena. The significance of these findings for understanding current and future distributions of I. scapularis, and of the pathogens it transmits, is discussed.},

Here we show that corals containing unusual algal symbionts that are thermally tolerant and commonly associated with high-temperature environments are much more abundant on reefs that have been severely affected by recent climate change. This adaptive shift in symbiont communities indicates that these devastated reefs could be more resistant to future thermal stress, resulting in significantly longer extinction times for surviving corals than had been previously assumed.},

	Abstract = {Temperature profoundly affects growth and life history traits in ectothermic animals through selection (i.e., genetic) and through direct effects on the phenotype (i.e., nongenetic/plasticity). We examined the effects of rearing temperature (24 degrees, 30 degrees, and 36 degrees C) on adult body size and development time and the interactive effects of temperature experienced during rearing and oviposition on several life history traits (age-at-first-reproduction, fecundity, egg size, egg development, and egg hatching) in two populations of the seed beetle, Stator limbatus, collected at different elevations. The higher elevation population was larger and matured sooner than the low-elevation population when raised at the lower temperature, but the reverse was true at the higher temperature suggesting that these populations have adapted to local temperature. There were interactions between the effects of rearing temperature and oviposition temperature for age-at-first-reproduction, fecundity, egg development, egg hatching, and two composite measures of fitness, generating complex reaction norms. The most dramatic example of this was a large maternal effect on egg hatching; females raised at low temperature produced eggs that had substantially reduced hatching when laid at hi h temperature. Our experimental design also allowed us to explore 0 9 the adaptive significance of acclimation. Beetles reared at intermediate or low temperature had the highest fitness at Multiple oviposition temperatures. There was little support for the "beneficial acclimation hypothesis," which predicts that beetles should have higher fitness at the temperature at which they were reared; acclimation had only a small effect on fitness. This study shows that temperature-mediated plasticity can be complex, but these complex patterns can yield new insights into the evolution of phenotypic plasticity.},

	Abstract = {Larval Protocalliphora Hough are obligate hematophagous parasites of nestling birds. While there is much interest in their effects on birds, little is known about the factors influencing their population sizes within nests. We experimentally increased temperature at nests of tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor Vieillot) on two study areas and compared densities of larval Protocalliphora with control nests. We found that number of Protocalliphora varied in a curvilinear fashion with temperature, with population sizes highest in nests around 25 degrees C and decreasing at both higher and lower temperatures. After controlling for temperature, we found differences between study areas in number of Protocalliphora in nests, and we hypothesize that these results are caused by differences in the size and dispersion of nests between the two areas. There was no seasonal variation in number of Protocalliphora in nests, but numbers increased significantly with the number of hosts in a nest, presumably because more resources were available for exploitation as host brood size increased. The cell-mediated immune responses of nestling tree swallows was positively correlated with number of Protocalliphora, and we suggest that these results are the consequence of the immune systems of nestlings in heavily parasitized nests being more sensitive to challenges by novel antigens or mitogens. To our knowledge, our study is the first to show variation in densities of larval Protocalliphora as a consequence of experimental manipulation of temperature and provides insight into important factors affecting population sizes of parasites in avian nests.},

	Abstract = {To date, coral death has been the most conspicuous outcome of warming tropical seas, but as temperatures stabilize at higher values, the consequences for the corals remaining will be mediated by their demographic responses to the sub-lethal effects of temperature. To gain insight into the nature of these responses, here I develop a model to test the effect of increased temperature on populations of three pocilloporid corals at One Tree Island, near the southern extreme of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Using Seriatopora hystrix, S. caliendrum and Pocillopora damicornis as study species, the effects of temperature on growth were determined empirically, and the dynamics of their populations determined under natural temperatures over a 6-month period between 1999 and 2000 [defined as the study year (SY)]. The two data sets were combined in a demographic test of the possibility that the thermal regime projected for the southern GBR in the next 55-83 years warmer by 3 degrees C than the study year (the SY + 3 regime), which is equivalent to 1.4 degrees C warmer than the recent warm year of 1998-would alter coral population trajectories through the effects on coral growth alone; the analyses first were completed by species, then by family after pooling among species. Laboratory experiments showed that growth rates (i.e., calcification) varied significantly among species and temperatures, and displayed curvilinear thermal responses with growth maxima at similar to 27.1 degrees C. Based on these temperature-growth responses, the SY + 3 regime is projected to: (1) increase annualized growth rates of all taxa by 24-39\%, and defer the timing of peak growth from the summer to the autumn and spring, (2) alter the intrinsic rate of population growth (lambda) for S. hystrix (lambda decreases 26\%) and S. caliendrum (lambda increases 5\%), but not for P. damicornis, and (3) have a minor effect on lambda (a 0.3\% increase) for the Pocilloporidae, largely because, varies more among species than it does between temperatures. Ten-year population projections suggest that the effects of a sub-lethal increase in temperature (i.e., the SY + 3 regime) are relatively small compared to the interspecific differences in population dynamics, but nevertheless will alter the population size and increase the relative abundance of large colonies at the expense of smaller colonies for all three species, as well as the Pocilloporidae. These effects may play an important role in determining the nuances of coral population structure as seawater warms, and their significance may intensity if the coral species pool is depleted of thermally sensitive species by bleaching.},

	Abstract = {Diverse biochemical and physiological adaptations enable different species of ectotherms to survive and reproduce in very different temperature regimes, but whether these adaptations fully compensate for the thermodynamically depressing effects of low temperature on rates of biological processes is debated. If such adaptations are fully compensatory, then temperature-dependent processes (e.g., digestion rate, population growth rate) of cold-adapted species will match those of warm-adapted species when each is measured at its own optimal temperature. Here we show that cold-adapted insect species have much lower maximum rates of population growth than do warm-adapted species, even when we control for phylogenetic relatedness. This pattern also holds when we use a structural-equation model to analyze alternative hypotheses that might otherwise explain this correlation. Thus, although physiological adaptations enable some insects to survive and reproduce at low temperatures, these adaptations do not overcome the "tyranny" of thermodynamics, at least for rates of population increase. Indeed, the sensitivity of population growth rates of insects to temperature is even greater than predicted by a recent thermodynamic model. Our findings suggest that adaptation to temperature inevitably alters the population dynamics of insects. This result has broad evolutionary and ecological consequences.},

	Abstract = {Anthropogenically induced global climate change has profound implications for marine ecosystems and the economic and social systems that depend upon them. The relationship between temperature and individual performance is reasonably well understood, and much climate-related research has focused on potential shifts in distribution and abundance driven directly by temperature. However, recent work has revealed that both abiotic changes and biological responses in the ocean will be substantially more complex. For example, changes in ocean chemistry may be more important than changes in temperature for the performance and survival of many organisms. Ocean circulation, which drives larval transport, will also change, with important consequences for population dynamics. Furthermore, climatic impacts on one or a few 'leverage species' may result in sweeping community-level changes. Finally, synergistic effects between climate and other anthropogenic variables, particularly fishing pressure, will likely exacerbate climate-induced changes. Efforts to manage and conserve living marine systems in the face of climate change will require improvements to the existing predictive framework. Key directions for future research include identifying key demographic transitions that influence population dynamics, predicting changes in the community-level impacts of ecologically dominant species, incorporating populations' ability to evolve (adapt), and understanding the scales over which climate will change and living systems will respond.},

	Abstract = {A central issue in ecology is to determine how environmental variations associated with global climate change, especially changing temperatures, affect trophic interactions in various ecosystems. This paper develops a temperature-dependent, stage-based, discrete, cohort model of the population dynamics of an insect pest under pressure from a predator. Guided by experimental data, the model is applied specifically to predation of grasshoppers by rangeland lycosid spiders. The development rate of insect arthropods is strongly affected by temperature, and these temperature-dependent phenological effects couple with shifts in the daily activity periods for both prey and predator, thereby increasing or decreasing opportunities for interaction. The model addresses these effects quantitatively by introducing a temperature-dependent, joint-activity factor that enters the predator's functional response. The model also includes a prey mortality rate that is temperature-dependent through the prey development rate. The model is parameterized using field and experimental data for spiders and grasshoppers. We investigate the effect of the solar power index (sunlight), mean temperature, and temperature variation, as measured by amplitude, on the developmental times and survivorship, both with, and without, predation. We conclude that increasing variation in temperature results in a stronger relative effect on survivorship due to predation. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {A simple mite population index (MPI) model is presented which predicts the effect on house dust mite populations of any combination of temperature and relative humidity (RH). For each combination, the output is an index, or multiplication factor, such that 1.1 indicates 10\% population growth and 0.9 indicates 10\% population decline. To provide data for the model, laboratory experiments have been carried out using lab cultures of Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus. The population change was observed for mites held in steady-state conditions at different combinations of temperature and RH over 21 days. From the results, a best-fit equation has been derived which forms the basis of the MPI model. The results also enable a new term to be defined: the Population Equilibrium Humidity, PEH, the RH for a given temperature at which house dust mite populations neither grow nor decline. It is similar to Critical Equilibrium Humidity, the RH below which house dust mites are unable to maintain water balance, but relates to a population of mites (rather than a physiological phenomenon) and is more able to take account of the observed effects of extremes of temperature and RH. Compared with previous population models, the MPI model is potentially more accurate and comprehensive. It can be combined with other simple models (described in previous papers), such as BED, which simulates the average hygrothermal conditions in a bed, given room conditions, and Condensation Targeter II, which simulates room conditions given a range of easily obtainable inputs for climate, house type and occupant characteristics. In this way it is now possible, for any individual dwelling, to assess the most effective means of controlling mite populations by environmental means, such as by improving standards of ventilation and insulation, or by modifying the occupant behaviour that affects the hygrothermal environment within a dwelling. Although the MPI model requires further development and validation, it has already proved useful for understanding more clearly how the different hygrothermal conditions found in beds and bedrooms can affect mite populations. It has also demonstrated that there is considerable scope for controlling mites by environmental means in cold winter climates such as the UK.},

	Abstract = {Timing of reproduction has major fitness consequences, which can only be understood when the phenology of the food for the offspring is quantified. For insectivorous birds, like great tits (Parus major), synchronisation of their offspring needs and abundance of caterpillars is the main selection pressure. We measured caterpillar biomass over a 20-year period and showed that the annual peak date is correlated with temperatures from 8 March to 17 May. Laying dates also correlate with temperatures, but over an earlier period (16 March-20 April). However, as we would predict from a reliable cue used by birds to time their reproduction, also the food peak correlates with these temperatures. Moreover, the slopes of the phenology of the birds and caterpillar biomass, when regressed against the temperatures in this earlier period, do not differ. The major difference is that due to climate change, the relationship between the timing of the food peak and the temperatures over the 16 March-20 April period is changing, while this is not so for great tit laying dates. As a consequence, the synchrony between offspring needs and the caterpillar biomass has been disrupted in the recent warm decades. This may have severe consequences as we show that both the number of fledglings as well as their fledging weight is affected by this synchrony. We use the descriptive models for both the caterpillar biomass peak as for the great tit laying dates to predict shifts in caterpillar and bird phenology 2005-2100, using an IPCC climate scenario. The birds will start breeding earlier and this advancement is predicted to be at the same rate as the advancement of the food peak, and hence they will not reduce the amount of the current mistiming of about 10 days.},

	Abstract = {The majority of taxa grow significantly during life history, which often leads to individuals of the same species having different ecological roles, depending on their size or life stage. One aspect of life history that changes during ontogeny is mortality. When individual growth and development are resource dependent, changes in mortality can affect the outcome of size-dependent intraspecific resource competition, in turn affecting both life history and population dynamics. We study the outcome of varying size-dependent mortality on two life-history types, one that feeds on the same resource throughout life history and another that can alternatively cannibalize smaller conspecifics. Compensatory responses in the life history dampen the effect of certain types of size-dependent mortality, while other types of mortality lead to dramatic changes in life history and population dynamics, including population (de-)stabilization, and the growth of cannibalistic giants. These responses differ strongly among the two life-history types. Our analysis provides a mechanistic understanding of the population-level effects that come about through the interaction between individual growth and size-dependent mortality, mediated by resource dependence in individual vital rates.},

	Abstract = {Many animal species live in groups. Group living may increase exploitation competition within the group, and variation among groups in intra-group competition intensity could induce life-history variability among groups. Models of physiologically structured populations generally predict single generation cycles, driven by exploitation competition within and between generations. We expect that life-history variability and habitat heterogeneity induced by group living may affect such competition-driven population dynamics. In this study, we vary the gregariousness (the tendency to aggregate in groups) of a size-structured consumer population in a spatially explicit environment. The consumer has limited mobility, and moves according to a probabilistic movement process. We study the effects on the population dynamics, as mediated through the resource and the life-history of the consumer. We find that high gregariousness leads to large spatial resource variation, and highly variable individual life-history, resulting in highly stochastic population dynamics. At reduced gregariousness, life-history of consumers synchronizes, habitat heterogeneity is reduced, and single generation cycles appear. We expect this pattern to occur for any group living organism with limited mobility. Our results indicate that constraints set by population dynamical feedback may be an important aspect in understanding group living in nature.},

	Abstract = {1. Temperature fluctuation is a general phenomenon affecting many, if not all, species in nature. While a few studies have shown that temperature fluctuation can promote species coexistence, little is known about the effects of different regimes of temperature fluctuation on coexistence. 2. We experimentally investigated how temperature fluctuation and different regimes of temperature fluctuation ('red' environments in which temperature series exhibited positive temporal autocorrelation vs. 'white' environments in which temperature series showed little autocorrelation) affected the coexistence of two ciliated protists, Colpidium striatum Stein and Paramecium tetraurelia Sonneborn, which competed for bacterial resources. 3. We have previously shown that the two species differed in their growth responses to changes in temperature and in their resource utilization patterns. The two species were not always able to coexist at constant temperatures (22, 24, 26, 28 and 30 degrees C), with Paramecium being competitively excluded at 26 and 28 degrees C. This indicated that resource partitioning was insufficient to maintain coexistence at these temperatures. 4. Here we show that in both red and white environments in which temperature varied between 22 and 32 degrees C, Paramecium coexisted with Colpidium. Consistent with the differential effects of temperature on their intrinsic growth rates, Paramecium population dynamics were largely unaffected by temperature regimes, and Colpidium showed more variable population dynamics in the red environments. 5. Temperature-dependent competitive effects of Colpidium on Paramecium, together with resource partitioning, appeared to be responsible for the coexistence in the white environments; resource partitioning and the storage effect appeared to account for the coexistence in the red environments. 6. These results suggest that temperature fluctuation may play important roles in regulating species coexistence and diversity in ecological communities.},

	Abstract = {The temperature-size rule is a common pattern of phenotypic plasticity in which higher temperature during development results in a smaller adult body size (i.e. a thermal reaction norm with negative slope). Examples and exceptions to the rule are known in multiple groups of organisms, but rapid population differentiation in the temperature-size rule has not been explored. Here we examine the genetic and parental contributions to population differentiation in thermal reaction norms for size, development time and survival in the Cabbage White Butterfly Pieris rapae, for two geographical populations that have likely diverged within the past 150 years. We used split-sibship experiments with two temperature treatments (warm and cool) for P. rapae from Chapel Hill, NC, and from Seattle, WA. Mixed-effect model analyses demonstrate significant genetic differences between NC and WA populations for adult size and for thermal reaction norms for size. Mean adult mass was 12-24\% greater in NC than in WA populations for both temperature treatments; mean size was unaffected or decreased with temperature (the temperature-size rule) for the WA population, but size increased with temperature for the NC population. Our study shows that the temperature-size rule and related thermal reaction norms can evolve rapidly within species in natural field conditions. Rapid evolutionary divergence argues against the existence of a simple, general mechanistic constraint as the underlying cause of the temperature-size rule.},

	Abstract = {The tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta has been an important model system in insect biology for more than half a century. Here we report the evolutionary divergence in thermal sensitivity and diapause initiation between field and laboratory populations that were separated for more than 35 yr ( 1240 laboratory generations) and that are descendants from the same field populations in central North Carolina. At intermediate rearing temperatures (20 degrees-25 degrees C), mean body size was significantly larger and development time significantly faster in the laboratory than in the field populations. At higher temperatures (30 degrees-35 degrees C), these mean differences between populations were reduced or eliminated, and larval survival at 35 degrees C was significantly lower in the laboratory population than in the field population. F-1 crosses had survival and development time to wandering similar to the field population times at both 25 degrees and 35 degrees C; body mass at wandering for F-1 crosses was intermediate compared with that of the field and laboratory populations. Comparisons with earlier field and laboratory studies suggest evolutionary reductions in thermal tolerance and performance at high temperatures in the laboratory population. The critical photoperiod initiating diapause in field populations in North Carolina did not change detectably between the 1960s and 2005. In contrast, the laboratory population has evolved a reduced tendency to diapause under short- day conditions, relative to the field population.},

Adopting similar experimental protocols, effects of salinity on population growth of A. sinjiensis were investigated under nine salinities of 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45 and 50 psu, with culture temperature set at 30 +/- 1 degrees C. In addition to population growth experiments, egg hatching rates (\%) after 48 h of incubation at various temperature and salinity conditions were also examined. For all experiments, five replicates were set up for each treatment. A. sinjiensis were fed an identical binary algal diet of Tetraselmis chuii and the Tahitian strain of Isochrysis sp. (T-ISO), photoperiod was maintained at 12 L: 12D. The results showed that temperature had significant effects on both population growth and egg hatching rates. Population growth at 30 degrees C (with an initial number of 10 adults/replicate, final mean population reached 677.2 +/- 136.6) was significantly higher (p < 0.00 1) than the other temperature treatments except that of 25 degrees C and 28 degrees C treatments. The egg hatching rate did not differ significantly (p < 0.05) when incubated at temperature 25, 3 0 and 34 degrees C although the highest hatching rate was recorded at 34 degrees C (96.3 +/- 2.2\%). Salinity also had significant effects on both population growth and egg hatching rates. The highest population growth (final mean population: 669.0 +/- 111.3) and egg hatching rate (98.0 +/- 1.4\%) both occurred at salinity of 30 psu. Population growth at 30 psu was significantly higher (p < 0.00 1) than all other treatments except that of 25 and 3 5 psu, while there was no significant difference (p < 0.05) between egg hatch rates at all salinity levels tested. The results of this study suggest that for maximum population growth and egg hatching success, A. sinjiensis should be cultured at 30 degrees C with a salinity of 30 psu. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

	Abstract = {Ecologists are increasingly adopting an evolutionary perspective, and in recent years, the idea that closely related species are ecologically similar has become widespread. In this regard, phylogenetic signal must be distinguished from phylogenetic niche conservatism. Phylogenetic niche conservatism results when closely related species are more ecologically similar that would be expected based on their phylogenetic relationships; its occurrence suggests that some process is constraining divergence among closely related species. In contrast, phylogenetic signal refers to the situation in which ecological similarity between species is related to phylogenetic relatedness; this is the expected outcome of Brownian motion divergence and thus is necessary, but not sufficient, evidence for the existence of phylogenetic niche conservatism. Although many workers consider phylogenetic niche conservatism to be common, a review of case studies indicates that ecological and phylogenetic similarities often are not related. Consequently, ecologists should not assume that phylogenetic niche conservatism exists, but rather should empirically examine the extent to which it occurs.},

@article{wolfshaar2008a,
	Abstract = {For most consumer species, winter represents a period of harsh food conditions in addition to the physiological strain that results from the low ambient temperatures. In size-structured populations, larger-bodied individuals do better during winter as they have larger energy reserves to buffer starvation periods. In contrast, smaller-bodied individuals do better under growing conditions, as they have lower maintenance costs. We study how the interplay between size-dependent life-history processes and seasonal changes in temperature and food availability shape the long-term dynamics of a size-structured consumer population and its unstructured resource. We show that the size dependence of maintenance requirements translates into a minimum body size that is needed for surviving starvation when consumers can adapt only to a limited extent to the low food densities in winter. This size threshold can lead to population extinction because adult individuals suffer only a little during winter and hence produce large numbers of offspring. Due to population feedback on the resource and intense intra-cohort competition, newborn consumers then fail to reach the size threshold for survival. Under these conditions, small numbers of individuals can survive, increase in density, and build up a population, which will subsequently go extinct due to its feedback on the resource. High juvenile mortality may prevent this ecological suicide from occurring, as it releases resource competition among newborns and speeds up their growth. In size-structured populations, annual fluctuations in temperature and food availability may thus lead to a conflict between individual fitness and population persistence.},

	Abstract = {We have analyzed the evolution of a quantitative trait in populations that are spatially extended along an environmental gradient, with gene flow between nearby locations. In the absence of competition, there is stabilizing selection toward a locally best-adapted trait that changes gradually along the gradient. According to traditional ideas, gradual spatial variation in environmental conditions is expected to lead to gradual variation in the evolved trait. A contrasting possibility is that the trait distribution instead breaks up into discrete clusters. Doebeli and Dieckmann (2003) argued that competition acting locally in trait space and geographical space can promote such clustering. We have investigated this possibility using deterministic population dynamics for asexual populations, analyzing our model numerically and through an analytical approximation. We examined how the evolution of clusters is affected by the shape of competition kernels, by the presence of Allee effects, and by the strength of gene flow along the gradient. For certain parameter ranges clustering was a robust outcome, and for other ranges there was no clustering. Our analysis shows that the shape of competition kernels is important for clustering: the sign structure of the Fourier transform of a competition kernel determines whether the kernel promotes clustering. Also, we found that Allee effects promote clustering, whereas gene flow can have a counteracting influence. In line with earlier findings, we could demonstrate that phenotypic clustering was favored by gradients of intermediate slope.},

	Abstract = {Hypothesis: The effects of temperature variation on life-history traits depend on both mean developmental temperature and geographic population of origin. Organism: Pitcher plant mosquitoes, Wyeomyia smithii. Field sites: We established laboratory colonies from three geographic populations spanning a latitudinal and altitudinal gradient in eastern North America. Sites at lower latitudes or altitudes experience both higher mean temperatures and greater thermal variability during the growing season. Methods: For each of the three sampled populations we analysed the effects of rearing temperature, population, and sex on survival, development time, and mass at pupation for mosquito larvae reared at 16, 20, and 27 degrees C constant temperatures. We also measured the same variables in two fluctuating temperature treatments with means of 20 and 27 degrees C. Using mixed linear models, we tested for the effects of mean temperature, temperature variation, population, and sex including all data except those from 16 degrees C constant. Results: Temperature variation did not have a significant effect on survival to pupation at 20 or 27 degrees C constant. However, low survival at 16 degrees C constant compared with high survival after transient exposure to the same temperature implies that duration of exposure may affect survival to pupation. The effects of temperature variation on both development time and pupal mass depended on mean temperature. Differences between constant and fluctuating temperatures for both these traits were predicted by the non-linear relationship between development rate and temperature (the Kaufmann effect). Moreover, this effect appears to explain geographic variation in the relationship between temperature variation and the measured life-history traits.},

	Abstract = {Given the rate of projected environmental change for the 21st century, urgent adaptation and mitigation measures are required to slow down the on-going erosion of biodiversity. Even though increasing evidence shows that recent human-induced environmental changes have already triggered species' range shifts, changes in phenology and species' extinctions, accurate projections of species' responses to future environmental changes are more difficult to ascertain. This is problematic, since there is a growing awareness of the need to adopt proactive conservation planning measures using forecasts of species' responses to future environmental changes. There is a substantial body of literature describing and assessing the impacts of various scenarios of climate and land-use change on species' distributions. Model predictions include a wide range of assumptions and limitations that are widely acknowledged but compromise their use for developing reliable adaptation and mitigation strategies for biodiversity. Indeed, amongst the most used models, few, if any, explicitly deal with migration processes, the dynamics of population at the \#trailing\#\#edge\# of shifting populations, species' interactions and the interaction between the effects of climate and land-use. In this review, we propose two main avenues to progress the understanding and prediction of the different processes occurring on the leading and trailing edge of the species' distribution in response to any global change phenomena. Deliberately focusing on plant species, we first explore the different ways to incorporate species' migration in the existing modelling approaches, given data and knowledge limitations and the dual effects of climate and land-use factors. Secondly, we explore the mechanisms and processes happening at the trailing edge of a shifting species' distribution and how to implement them into a modelling approach. We finally conclude this review with clear guidelines on how such modelling improvements will benefit conservation strategies in a changing world.},

@article{de-roos2008a,
	Abstract = {Prey in natural communities are usually shared by many predator species. How predators coexist while competing for the same prey is one of the fundamental questions in ecology. Here, we show that competing predator species may not only coexist on a single prey but even help each other to persist if they specialize on different life history stages of the prey. By changing the prey size distribution, a predator species may in fact increase the amount of prey available for its competitor. Surprisingly, a predator may not be able to persist at all unless its competitor is also present. The competitor thus significantly increases the range of conditions for which a particular predator can persist. This "emergent facilitation" is a long-term, population-level effect that results from asymmetric increases in the rate of prey maturation and reproduction when predation relaxes competition among prey. Emergent facilitation explains observations of correlated increases of predators on small and large conspecific prey as well as concordance in their distribution patterns. Our results suggest that emergent facilitation may promote the occurrence of complex, stable, community food webs and that persistence of these communities could critically depend on diversity within predator guilds.},

	Abstract = {Four experiments were conducted on the calanoid copepod, Pseudodiaptomus pelagicus, to determine the effects of temperature (24, 26, 28, 30, 32, and 34 degrees C) on survival, development time, reproductive output, and population growth in order to define the optimal temperature for culture. The first experiment stocked early stage nauplii into I L beakers and cultured them using standard procedures until five days after the first mature adults were observed; from this survival, sex ratio, time to maturation, and fecundity were measured. The second and third experiments evaluated the effects of temperature on nauplii production by stocking individual pairs and 25 pairs of adults, respectively; in both experiments nauplii production was determined daily for 10 days. The fourth experiment determined the effects of temperature on population growth and composition of the population produced by stocking 10 adult pairs and culturing them for 10 days at six temperatures. Results indicate survival from early nauplii to adult was significantly affected by temperature and those cultured from 24-30 degrees C had the highest mean survival. Time to first maturation and maturation of the entire population was significantly influenced by temperature and took from 6.8 to 12.8 days. Temperature significantly affected nauplii production in both individual and groups of paired adults. Temperature affected the mean daily nauplii production by decreasing the brood interval but did not affect the mean brood size. The number of nauplii produced by 25 adult pairs was significantly influenced by temperature; the optimal temperature was 27.5 degrees C at which 1861 nauplii were produced. The distribution of developmental stages in the population was also affected by temperature; at lower temperatures the population consisted of a greater proportion of nauplii while at 32 degrees C the population was comprised of more advanced staged individuals. When developing production objectives, aquaculturists must consider temperature because it has multiple effects on the culture of P. pelagicus. The optimal temperature range to achieve high survival and the greatest nauplii production is 26-30 degrees C. To maintain long-term stock cultures the best temperature may be 24 degrees C to slow maturation and growth while 28-32 degrees C may be used to maximize nauplii production by decreasing time to maturation and decreasing brood intervals.

@article{rolland2009a,
	Abstract = {Climate and human activities such as fisheries impact many animal species. However, the demographic processes through which the population vital rates are affected, and the sensitivity of their growth rates, are poorly understood. The Black-browed Albatross, Thalassarche melanophrys, is a long-lived threatened seabird species. Previous studies have shown that the adult survival and breeding success of the population breeding at Kerguelen are affected by sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) during both the breeding and the nonbreeding season, and by tuna long-lining in Tasmanian waters through bycatch mortality. Here, using long-term demographic data from a Black-browed Albatross colony monitored for 26 years at Kerguelen, we estimate all demographic parameters from early to adult stages of the life cycle in order to build a fully parameterized population model and predict population growth rates under several scenarios of climate and fishing effort. The observed population growth rate (1.003) indicates that the population was stable or slightly increasing, and our population model gives a close estimate of 1.008. Population growth rate is more sensitive to survival of experienced breeders and accordingly to a change in SSTA during incubation and to tuna long-lining effort (both affecting survival of experienced breeders) than to other demographic parameters/environmental covariates. The population stability results from multiple factors and complex relationships between demographic parameters and environmental conditions, and therefore population equilibrium is precarious. If fishing effort remains stable at its current level and positive SSTA increase, or inversely if fishing effort decreases and SSTA remain similar to present values, then the population would increase. However, if fishing effort increases by 20\% (i.e., to 40 million hooks) on the wintering grounds, without any change in SSTA, then the population would decrease at 0.9\% per year. If fishing effort stops, the population would increase at 3.5\% per year, suggesting that bycatch mortality probably currently limits the Black-browed Albatross population at Kerguelen. Our study shows how this type of model could be useful to predict trajectories of top predator populations, and eventually lower trophic web levels, in relation to climatic projections and future human activities.

	Abstract = {Adaptation to temporal variation in environmental conditions is widespread. Whether evolution in a constant environment alters adaptation to temporal variation is relatively unexplored. We examine how constant and diurnally fluctuating temperature conditions affect life-history traits in two populations of the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta: a field population that routinely experiences fluctuating temperatures; and a laboratory population (derived from this field population in the 1960s) maintained at a constant temperature for more than 250 generations. Our experiments demonstrate that diurnal fluctuations significantly alter body size and development time in both populations, and confirm that these populations differ in their responses to a mean temperature. However, we found no evidence for population divergence in responses to diurnal temperature fluctuations. We suggest that mean and extreme temperatures may act as more potent selective forces on thermal reaction norms than temperature variation per se.},

	Abstract = {The relative importance of density-dependent and -independent processes in determining population density has been predicted to vary according to whether the population concerned is located near the centre or the periphery of the species' range. Thus, density-independent processes should be more pronounced near the periphery. The long-tailed wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus in Iceland is at the northern and western edge of its geographical range. We estimated the autumn population density in an open habitat in south-western Iceland in 9 years out of 10 during 1996-2005 in order to monitor the annual maximum population size. Furthermore, we estimated population density and survival at c. 5-week intervals from September 2001 to October 2003 and from September 2004 to November 2005 in order to reveal the causes of variation in maximum population size. The estimated autumn population density was low, ranging from 2.7 to 8.9 mice ha(-1) while spring densities ranged from 0.4 to 0.8 mice ha(-1). Apparent monthly survival probabilities ranged from 0.4 to 0.7 per month in autumn and 0.7 to 0.9 in winter. Our results suggest that low temperature in early winter (October-December) is the major determinant of population density in the following autumn, explaining 74\% of the variation in autumn population density. No significant correlation was found between either the NAO index or the NAO winter index and variation in wood mouse population density in autumn. Differential mortality in early winter results in variation in spring population size. This study shows clear evidence of density-independent control of a mammal population at the edge of its geographical range as opposed to the mostly density-dependent control previously recorded near its centre of distribution.},

	Abstract = {The initial rise of fitness that occurs with increasing temperature is attributed to Arrhenius kinetics, in which rates of reaction increase exponentially with increasing temperature. Models based on Arrhenius typically assume single rate-limiting reactions over some physiological temperature range for which all the rate-limiting enzymes are in 100\% active conformation. We test this assumption using data sets for microbes that have measurements of fitness (intrinsic rate of population growth) at many temperatures and over a broad temperature range and for diverse ectotherms that have measurements at fewer temperatures. When measurements are available at many temperatures, strictly Arrhenius kinetics are rejected over the physiological temperature range. However, over a narrower temperature range, we cannot reject strictly Arrhenius kinetics. The temperature range also affects estimates of the temperature dependence of fitness. These results indicate that Arrhenius kinetics only apply over a narrow range of temperatures for ectotherms, complicating attempts to identify general patterns of temperature dependence.},

	Abstract = {Tilmans theory predicts the outcome of competition between two consumers sharing two resources on the basis of the shape of zero net-growth isoclines (ZNGIs). In his theory, intraspecific differences in resource use are not accounted for. Here we extend this theory to include situations where organisms undergo ontogenetic diet shifts, as these characterize the life histories of many species. In a situation that without diet shifts would lead to neutral coexistence of consumer species, we investigate whether ontogenetic diet shifts lead to niche partitioning. We analyze a model describing competition for two resources between two competitors with distinctive diets over ontogeny, using copepods (showing ontogenetic diet shifts) and daphnids (not showing ontogenetic diet shifts) as appropriate representatives. We show that an ontogenetic diet shift affects the shape of the ZNGI, changing it from reflecting perfectly substitutable resources to reflecting essential resources. Furthermore, we show that resource supply determines population stage structure and stage-dependent resource consumption in copepods and influences the competitive outcome with daphnids. In particular, we show that in itself, an ontogenetic diet shift can provide a competitive advantage if the supply of the adult resource is lower than the supply of the juvenile resource but that it always causes a disadvantage if the supply of the adult resource exceeds that of the juvenile resource.},

	Abstract = {Climate change affects both the mean and variability of climatic variables, but their relative impact on the dynamics of populations is still largely unexplored. Based on a long-term study of the demography of a declining Eurasian Oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus) population, we quantify the effect of changes in mean and variance of winter temperature on different vital rates across the life cycle. Subsequently, we quantify, using stochastic stage-structured models, how changes in the mean and variance of this environmental variable affect important characteristics of the future population dynamics, such as the time to extinction. Local mean winter temperature is predicted to strongly increase, and we show that this is likely to increase the population's persistence time via its positive effects on adult survival that outweigh the negative effects that higher temperatures have on fecundity. Interannual variation in winter temperature is predicted to decrease, which is also likely to increase persistence time via its positive effects on adult survival that outweigh the negative effects that lower temperature variability has on fecundity. Overall, a 0.1 degrees C change in mean temperature is predicted to alter median time to extinction by 1.5 times as many years as would a 0.1 degrees C change in the standard deviation in temperature, suggesting that the dynamics of oystercatchers are more sensitive to changes in the mean than in the interannual variability of this climatic variable. Moreover, as climate models predict larger changes in the mean than in the standard deviation of local winter temperature, the effects of future climatic variability on this population's time to extinction are expected to be overwhelmed by the effects of changes in climatic means. We discuss the mechanisms by which climatic variability can either increase or decrease population viability and how this might depend both on species' life histories and on the vital rates affected. This study illustrates that, for making reliable inferences about population consequences in species in which life history changes with age or stage, it is crucial to investigate the impact of climate change on vital rates across the entire life cycle. Disturbingly, such data are unavailable for most species of conservation concern.},

	Abstract = {An important challenge facing ecologists is to understand how climate change may affect species performance and species interactions. However, predicting how changes in abiotic variables associated with climate change may affect species performance also depends on the biotic context, which can mediate species responses to climatic change. We conducted a 3-yr field experiment to determine how the herbivorous grasshopper Camnula pellucida (Scudder) responds to manipulations of temperature and population density. Grasshopper survival and fecundity decreased with density, indicating the importance of intraspecific competition. Female fecundity tended to increase with temperature, whereas grasshopper survival exhibited a unimodal response to temperature, with highest survival at intermediate temperatures. Grasshopper performance responses to temperature also depended on density. Peak survival in the low-density treatment occurred in warmer conditions than for the high-density treatment, indicating that the intensity of intraspecific competition varies with temperature. Our data show that changes to the temperature regimen can alter grasshopper performance and determine the intensity of intraspecific competition. However, the effects of temperature on grasshopper performance varied with density. Our data indicate the importance of the biotic context in mediating species responses to climatic factors associated with global change.},

	Abstract = {Forecasting the ecological effects of climate change on marine species is critical for informing greenhouse gas mitigation targets and developing marine conservation strategies that remain effective and increase species' resilience under changing climate conditions. Highly productive coastal upwelling systems are predicted to experience substantial effects from climate change, making them priorities for ecological forecasting. We used a population modeling approach to examine the consequences of ocean climate change in the California Current upwelling ecosystem on the population growth rate of the planktivorous seabird Cassin's auklet (Ptychoramphus aleuticus), a demographically sensitive indicator of marine climate change. We use future climate projections for sea surface temperature and upwelling intensity from a regional climate model to forecast changes in the population growth rate of the auklet population at the important Farallon Island colony in central California. Our study projected that the auklet population growth rate will experience an absolute decline of 11-45\% by the end of the century, placing this population on a trajectory toward extinction. In addition, future changes in upwelling intensity and timing of peak upwelling are likely to vary across auklet foraging regions in the California Current Ecosystem (CCE), producing a mosaic of climate conditions and ecological impacts across the auklet range. Overall, the Farallon Island Cassin's auklet population has been declining during recent decades, and ocean climate change in this century under a mid-level emissions scenario is projected to accelerate this decline, leading toward population extinction. Because our study species has proven to be a sensitive indicator of oceanographic conditions in the CCE and a powerful predictor of the abundance of other important predators (i.e. salmon), the significant impacts we predicted for the Cassin's auklet provide insights into the consequences that ocean climate change may have for other plankton predators in this system.},

@article{sasaki2010a,
	Abstract = {Ecological interaction, including competition for resources, often causes frequency-dependent disruptive selection, which, when accompanied by reproductive isolation, may act as driving forces of adaptive speciation. While adaptive dynamics models have added new perspectives to our understanding of the ecological dimensions of speciation processes, it remains an open question how best to incorporate and analyze genetic detail in such models. Conventional approaches, based on quantitative genetics theory, typically assume a unimodal character distribution and examine how its moments change over time. Such approximations inevitably fail when a character distribution becomes multimodal. Here, we propose a new approximation, oligomorphic dynamics, to the quantitative genetics of populations that include several morphs and that therefore exhibit multiple peaks in their character distribution. To this end, we first decompose the character distribution into a sum of unimodal distributions corresponding to individual morphs. Characterizing these morphs by their frequency (fraction of individuals belonging to each morph), position (mean character of each morph), and width (standard deviation of each morph), we then derive the coupled eco-evolutionary dynamics of morphs through a double Taylor expansion. We show that the demographic, convergence, and evolutionary stability of a population's character distribution correspond, respectively, to the asymptotic stability of frequencies, positions, and widths under the oligomorphic dynamics introduced here. As first applications of oligomorphic dynamics theory, we analytically derive the effects (a) of the strength of disruptive selection on waiting times until speciation, (b) of mutation on conditions for speciation, and (c) of the fourth moments of competition kernels on patterns of speciation.},

@article{brunel2010a,
	Abstract = {The effect of temperature and population density on the growth of Atlantic herring Clupea harengus was studied using a comparative approach applied to 15 North Atlantic populations. The von Bertalanffy (VB) equation was applied to describe mean growth of individuals in each population, both averaged over the whole period studied and for each cohort. Water temperature was a determinant factor for herring growth at the species level: North Atlantic herring in cold water areas exhibited a lower growth coefficient (k), longer lifespan and a higher asymptotic weight (w(inf)) than those living in warmer water. The average w(inf) of herring was positively correlated to the density of biomass of that population. This relationship was most likely due to the negative correlation found between population density and mean temperature. At the within-population level, when looking at the temporal variability in growth parameters amongst cohorts, w(inf) was still negatively correlated to temperature, but the positive correlation between k and temperature was no longer significant. In a single population, the temperature range is probably too narrow to have an identifiable effect on growth. The effect may be confounded by other factors such as density dependence. On the basis of this macroecological pattern, global warming should enhance growth of the youngest age-classes, but reduce the growth of older individuals and shorten the lifespan of herring.},
